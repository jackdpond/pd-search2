And the fact that a singular, all powerful creator ruler being is what probably comes in to most Westerners minds when they hear the word God, that shows you the influence of these particular religions in our history. Because that's not what most humans for most of human history have believed. Here's what's fascinating. You can go look up Dictionary.com, oxford English Dictionary. If you look up the term monotheism, it gives you a definition that doesn't actually correspond to what Jews and Christians have believed about God for most of their history. And so here's the English this Dictionary.com, so English definition of monotheism, the belief that there is only one God. Like that's the short definition. The belief that there is only one God. And that seems intuitive. Mono, one theism, God. Right, one God. The implication being, therefore there are no other beings that can be described or identified by the noun God or gods. Monotheism.

The Naked Bible Podcast and a great podcast that's called the Naked Bible Podcast. And he has a book called the Unseen Realm that's been one of the helpful resources that I've been looking at as I put all this together. So here's how Heiser puts it. If he says if we're trying to just understand how the Hebrew Bible uses the word God, Yahweh is an Elohim, but no other Elohim is Yahweh. Elohim, Heiser concludes, is a place of residence term. The word tells you what the proper domain is for that being by nature the God of Israel, the many Elohim of God's counsel. Demons, angels, the departed, dead, like Samuel. These can all be referred to with the word Elohim. So what do they have in common? They're part of a non physical domain that's related to but also distinct from the physical embodied domain. So an Elohim is by definition and by nature a disembodied entity. So the word can refer to many different beings who inhabit that realm. That's his conclusion, and I think that's helpful.",
