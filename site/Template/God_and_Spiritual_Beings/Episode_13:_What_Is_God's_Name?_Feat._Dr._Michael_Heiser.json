If you've been following along in the podcast, you'll know that we're in the middle of a series exploring the identity of God in the Bible, how the ancient biblical writers thought about what it's like to experience a transcendent God. If you've been listening along, you'll recall that we did a question and response episode where tim referred to Dr. Michael Heiser. Well, we had the privilege of hanging out with Mike Heiser here in Portland at our studios last week to talk shop and get an outside voice in our script writing process. So while we were hanging out with Mike, the topic of the name of God came up. And this is something we talked about on the podcast before, how the name of God is an attribute that becomes more than an attribute. And as soon as we started talking about it, I realized, man, we need to record this conversation. There's some really good stuff here about what does it mean to take the Lord's name in vain, what it means to just take the Lord's name in any capacity, and how's that related to taking the name of the beast, which is actually the phrase used in Revelation. We talk about all that and more. A little bit more about Mike. He did his graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania in ancient history, and then he did his doctoral studies at the University of Madison, Wisconsin in Hebrew, Bible and Semitic languages, which is the exact program that Tim went through. He's currently a scholar in residence at Logos Bible Software, which is north of Seattle in our neck of the woods. He's got a lot of great books. If you haven't read the Unseen Realm, I'd recommend picking that up. He also has a brand new book out on angels. Oh, and he has his own podcast, the Naked Bible Podcast, where he weekly gets very nerdy about the Bible. It was a lot of fun to have him in the office. I hope you enjoy this conversation. Here we go. Okay. We are going to talk about the name Hashem.",

Not by name, but sort of as an individual, as a person. Tim, I don't know if you. I won't give any names for our professors at the uw, but there was one in particular I was going through that we all got the little lecture about what happens when we encounter the Divine Name in reading text and what to do and what not to do. And so his instructions at the time were, okay, when we're reading text in class and you come to the Divine Name, I don't want to hear anyone try to pronounce it.

Well, we can't really pronounce it because we don't really know how it was vocalized. And that's. That's good because we're not supposed to pretend that we kind of have a chummy relationship with this transcendent being. There are a number of factors that go into it, but for me, it was an introduction to something I encountered later in Deuteronomy. There are places in Deuteronomy that talk about God tells Moses, now, you're going to go into the land. You're going to do this and that, and you're going to go to the place where I will put my name.

It was a way of expressing the idea that when we get in here, God is going to choose to dwell among us in a particular location, sort of foreshadowing the temple.

They know what is being communicated here, that now we have a man who was born of a virgin. We have the incarnation idea. We have somebody who lived among us. The Word becoming flesh that is linked to all of these ways that God himself showed up in scenes as a human being. And so the messaging can't really be any clearer. This is where it all led. It led to this person being now incarnate, born of a woman. But they have the category into which this fits. And so then they're forced with a decision. Do we accept the idea that Jesus of Nazareth, who we know is actually the incarnation of this being God is man in the Old Testament, Is this where the trail, so to speak, ends with him as Messiah? And that was a big deal. They had to make a choice. They had to make a decision. But I think it's important to realize the Old Testament backdrop to this, because the big stumbling block for a Jew when it came to deciding to embrace Jesus was if I worship Jesus, if I embrace him and believe that he's God in the flesh and he's the Messiah and he's the rightful king because of what the Old Testament says in these passages and other passages, they had to wonder, am I violating the fundamental tenet of the Old Testament faith, which is the Lord our God is one? That was a thing that they had to realize that. Well, wait a minute, I'm not really violating that. Because back in the Old Testament, there was God as man visible, but that didn't mean that God wasn't in heaven. You know, you still have God transcendent, but now you have God imminent in human form. So there's this two ness kind of thing going on. And if that wasn't a violation of God's own command, then why would it be a violation now?",

And what he discusses in that book is, hey, you know, our own tradition as Jews used to teach that there were two Yahweh figures. There was again the invisible transcendent one, and then there was this second one who was the same in terms of being Yahweh, but was also distinct in some ways. And one of the ways that gets expressed is the angel. So Siegel is tracking on this, and what he wants to do in the book is he asked a really simple but profound question. Where did we lose this?

So there's this element of, yeah, we're going to be like him. It's not like we become him and displace him or like absorb him or something like that. We are perfectly and finally conformed to his image.

You do have God dwelling inside believers in the form of the Spirit. So it takes you off in that direction of the relationship of Jesus to the Spirit.

Where two or three are gathered in my name, I'm in their midst. It's because of this, again, really fascinating relationship between Jesus and the Spirit. Spirit of Jesus, Spirit of Christ, Spirit of God. They're interchangeable terms. Paul says, the Lord who is the Spirit. A couple of times. It takes you in so many different directions. And when the Spirit. When you realize that the Spirit of God dwelling in believers is the same Deity that tabernacled with the Israelites in the desert or in Jerusalem, and also that was in this angel, it links us with this whole set of ideas. And again, it doesn't mean that God goes away or is displaced or is lesser. It means that we are brought into the family. We're members of his body, the Body of Christ. We are in Christ. All of these phrases are terms that try to get at who we are now, but who we will ultimately be in such close identification with Jesus that he has to actually use this kind of terminology. But we're still distinct. So if people struggle with this idea of this visible Yahweh, and he is Yahweh, but he's distinct from Yahweh. Well, Christian, do you realize who you are?
