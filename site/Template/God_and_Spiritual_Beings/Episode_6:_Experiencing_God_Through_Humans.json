And he's done a lot of work on the concept of Jesus deity in the New Testament. And in light of all that, he's been a really influential person on me. He has a helpful way of at least giving language that I think will be helpful as we go on. So he talks about how most human cultures or most of human history have had a gradient.

We could call this a transcendent uniqueness, understanding the uniqueness of the God of Israel as the one creator and the one sovereign ruler of all things. So he, as he's surveyed all the literature, all the ancient literature, he notices these themes. What is it that puts Yahweh in utter unique category from any other being, Elohim or human? He's the only creator. That is, no other Elohim participated with Yahweh in generating the universe. So you survey the literature. That's one distinct character trait. The other one is Yahweh is the sovereign ruler. He might Delegate authority for this or that. But ultimately he's the one guiding the ship. He goes on. In ancient Judaism, this binary distinction between God and all other reality was observed and promoted by. He calls monolatry, which is a weird.",

So his point here is that Judaism, to finish quoting him, Judaism turned their monolatry, their worship of one God into a powerful cultural symbol of exclusive monotheism. So you can't just talk about what did these biblical authors and Israelites believe. We also have to look at their behavior. Their behavior and their beliefs mesh into this very particular way of life. There you go. That's a binary view of reality. So just ask yourself this. If you hold the theological belief that there's only one Elohim, that's the creator of all and the ruler of all, and worthy of your allegiance and worship. But then you also have received all this traditional literature that you believe is authoritative and comes from that God that reveals that God. And there's all these stories that show God relating to people in very different kinds of ways. And so what you're going to see is biblical authors on this balance beam because they believe that Yahweh is transcendent, unique, above all, totally different than all other reality. Transcendent is what Baucom called it. At the same time, they believe that.

They're going to develop a very nuanced vocabulary and they're going to draw a nuanced portrait in the stories of the Bible about God's transcendence, but also his involvement. So what you see is that God relates to the world most often through some kind of mediator figure.

And then once you move on, especially once Moses dies, most everybody's interacting with Yahweh, the God of Israel, by means of some other mediator. The majority of times in the whole Bible, Old and New Testament, when God appears, Yahweh God appears and interacts with people. It's through mediators and a whole host of mediators. Many humans act as mediators on God's behalf to other humans. And that's a very common way that God interacts with the world in the Bible. So priests, prophets, kings, that kind of thing. But then you have these other Elohim, which are sometimes called Elohim. Other times they're called angels or just messengers. And then other times there are these what Bible nerds call personifications. They're attributes of God that are personified as characters in stories. So God's name, God's glory, God's word, God's spirit, God's wisdom. There's all stories and poems about each of those divine attributes that are depicted in narratives in some form as being characters that are God but are also distinct from God and mediating God in some way.",

So mostly I just want to walk you through those big categories and give you examples. And again, here's why is because when we go to the New Testament and look at how the apostles describe Jesus, they're going to draw upon all of these categories. In other words, they're going to describe Jesus with the language of these different types of agents or mediators that God uses in the Hebrew Bible.
