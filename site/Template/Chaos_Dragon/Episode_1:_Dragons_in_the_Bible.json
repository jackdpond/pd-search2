It's like, when the kingdom of God advances, the elevated status of the adversary is brought down to the land. Interesting. Then he says, look, I've given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy snakes and scorpions, you can stomp on them. Yeah. We didn't read this in Genesis 3. That begins to sound like what God said to the nachos in Genesis 3, which was, you're going to go on your belly. We read that, and one day there's going to be a seed from the woman, a descendant, who's going to crush you on the head while you strike him on the heel.

And what ideas, stories, experiences came into their mind when they heard stories about a deity slaying or confronting a sea dragon and building a kingdom on a mountain over the nations as a result. This was a widespread cultural story in so many ancient cultures. So what the biblical authors are doing is that they're actually deploying well worn images and storylines, but putting those images in the service of a more unique set of ideas and claims about God and reality and good and evil and humans. But they're doing it. This language is a cross cultural language in the ancient world of mountains and dragons.
