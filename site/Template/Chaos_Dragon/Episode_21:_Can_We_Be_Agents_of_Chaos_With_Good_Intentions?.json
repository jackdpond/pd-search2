Yeah, that's a key part of the story. And then he goes to this guy's house named Ananias who gets up and prays for him. And then we're told that he regains his sight and is filled with God's spirit.

Who's from Tasmania? Hey, Tim and John. My name is Zeb and I'm from Tasmania in Australia. You guys and the whole Bible Project team are amazing, and you're such a blessing. You briefly mentioned in episode 12, Rahab, and you linked the name and title to the sea monster image. I'm just tracing my mind to the book of Joshua and Rahab who lived in Jericho. Jericho means fragrant. Is there some sort of inverted link between Rahab's name and character portrayed against the city of Jericho and its name and character in the story? Rahab seems to be the only thing of fragrance in Jericho, and the city itself is more like the chaotic sea dragon. Am I reading this right? What are your thoughts? Keep up the incredible work.

This is one of those elements where I love that so many people, when they learned that Rahav was a name for the sea dragon, especially in the poetic books, the prophets and the Psalms. But it's a uniquely Israelite name. And then people think of the character, biblical character, the prostitute Rahab who lived and rescued the spies in the city of Joshua. So, first off, I love that people are seeing the connection because that's totally how hyperlinks work. It also is a good opportunity to say that learning some facility to learn how to use original language concordances or lexicons can be real helpful, because in this case, even though the names are spelled the same in English, they are different in Hebrew. So Rahav the dragon is from Resh. Hey, Bet. Rahav. So it's spelled like it sounds in English, which from a verb, rahav, to like a raging storm. The raging one is the dragon name. The Rahab in Jericho is a different word even though it's spelled the same thing in English. Yeah, it's Reish, Chet. Bet. So Rachav, which means to Be broad or wide open.",

If I could really see what they're after, what's the good that they are after, but in a destructive way, and what are the good things that I'm after through even intentionally destructive ways.

So the snake influences through a false. A distortion of reality, and putting that in front of people's imaginations. Then the Cain story, even though it's implicit and we've had to meditate on it for years, there's something about him, an idea entering his mind that is called sin. That's like an animal that wants him. And then when he acts on that, he murders his brother in the field. So we're being asked to see some kind of influence, like a beastly influence on his imagination. And so that's when we introduce that image of putting on the costume. Another way to say it is you incarnate. You become an embodiment, as it were, of the dragon. So the Kane story really kicks off that motif, and then you get lamech. And then all these moments later in the story where people start doing horrible things to each other. We're meant to have, like, the Cain template, you know, kind of underlying all of that, which is why people can be called dragons. So what's interesting, then, John uses two phrases, actually, all the way back in John chapter 13, when he describes. Okay, so hold on. So Judas. Judas is the person who got Jesus arrested.

Because we know from Jesus teachings for him, it's actually leading Israel to see that it's only by letting go of some vision that we have of how Israel is supposed to exist in the world, that this is a family called to give up everything and surrender over to God, even if that means death, to open up the gates of Eden and eternal life for the nations. And that what Jesus believed was Israel's unique calling in the world to suffer, to unleash the life of Eden to the nations and to not fear death. And Judas thought that that was apparently thought that was an insane move that was only gonna bring more trouble. So the devil put it into his heart. Then later, at the end of John 13 when it actually happens, what we're told is that the Satan entered into Judas. So it uses a different phrase, the Satan entered into him. So he has two ways of putting it. The devil, the slanderer putting something into your heart, or the opposer entering into somebody. But that's another way of thinking about Cain too.",
