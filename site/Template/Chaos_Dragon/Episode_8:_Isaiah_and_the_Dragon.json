From the opening pages of Scripture, we encounter a destructive force that the authors of the Bible depict as a serpent bent on deceiving humanity. Again and again, we see that God's human image bearers choose to side with chaos instead of with God and so become themselves chaos monsters as well. Today, we open up the scroll of Isaiah, and we see the prophet Isaiah warning Israel that they have become the chaos monster, aligning with death and destruction instead of partnering with Yahweh. And so God has to deal with the chaos that Israel has brought.",

And so when they wrote, they wrote in the language set In a time and a place and so on. So we're always. That's a big value for us, is to honor that historical context of the biblical writings. But there's something about this theme in particular, because the dragon slaying story was so widespread among Israel's neighbors, going way and even, like, predating Israel in the neighboring cultures, and the way biblical authors use specific images, words and phrases that are very popular in this widespread tradition, but then they tweak them, and that's just something.

And it's a story about baal, or baal, who was a Canaanite storm God against the serpent called Lotan and against the sea called Yam. And there BAAL has to undergo this defeat of the dragon and victory. And then he actually dies after the battle and then he gets resurrected again, brought up from the dead. And it happens every year and it's a whole agricultural cycle imagery. Over in Babylon, which is the other version the biblical authors know the most because they lived there in Babylonian exile, is the version about Marduk that we know through a text called Enuma Elish. And there Marduk's victory over the sea, Tiamat and her monster army, which includes lions and dragons and hairy beastmen. There the story is ritually reenacted every year at the new year in the fall. The fall new year. So it's cyclical and the biblical authors have a different view of reality.",

However, the fact that it becomes an agent of bad in God's world implies some sort of choice on its part to not participate in the flourishing of God's good creation, but rather trying to drag it back into the nothingness and disorder from which it emerged.

So what I want to focus on is the imagery of the dragon and the rebel star being. The rebel star being in Isaiah's oracles against the nations in Isaiah, chapters 13 to 27.

He lived in Jerusalem in the mid to late seven hundreds B.C. he's connected to the reign of four kings, but specifically his.

So Isaiah 1:12 begins with Isaiah's announcement that Jerusalem is headed for ruin because Israel has been faithless to the covenant and God is going to allow these imperial monsters to come eat up Jerusalem, but as a fire of testing to purify Jerusalem so that after that attack, a new Jerusalem can emerge out the other side. So we have read many times over the years the important poems in Isaiah chapter 2 and Isaiah 11 that both depict the ultimate future of a cosmic new Jerusalem that the nations will all gather into. There'll be no more war. There'll be a royal priestly leader from the line of David who will bring about a new Eden. Hooray and amen. So we just finished that Isaiah 1:12 with those kind of framing images in Isaiah 2 and 11, when you walk into Isaiah 2, chapter 13 to 27, this is a whole collection of what's called oracles against the nations.

I mean, that's a very unique story compared to the neighboring stories of saying, you know, this creature of chaos is in a battle against God, the God of the sky, and they gotta duke it out and the God of the sky is gonna win.

We haven't read any of the texts yet, but what the biblical author's deepest conviction is that Yahweh, the creator of heaven and earth, is ultimate reality. There is no reality more transcendent above and beyond than Yahweh Elohim. So whatever chaos and death is, it's down the chain of causation of importance and significance or sovereignty and power and authority. So sometimes the biblical authors want to highlight that Yahweh Elohim is the ultimate cause and the source of all reality. And so they'll depict scenes of divine judgment or God bringing justice on human evil as God doing it himself. There are other times when they'll depict God using agents to do it on his behalf. And that's what we find, like here in Isaiah. But there are also images in Isaiah where we'll just talk about God sending the fire on Jerusalem. And so I think it's more. The biblical authors actually have a more nuanced way of thinking about cause and effect and God's relationship to cause and effect. And sometimes they just take the causes all the way up to the ultimate source, and other times they focus on secondary or third agents. And the dragon, I think, falls into that category.",

But then in the Cain story, we're taught that there's just a voice in Cain's ear called sin that wants him, wants to consume him, an animal, but he's called to rule it like the animals, and he doesn't. And so after that, then we saw with Lamech and then Nimrod and then Pharaoh and then, sheesh, where'd we go after that? Sisera. And then Goliath. And what was Goliath except one of these like champion warriors. Right. Who's making fun of the king of Babylon now. So humans can become agents of this cosmic chaos monster that can be depicted as a sea monster, but also now here depicted in the language of a rebel star. And this brings us all the way back to Remembering in Genesis 1 the bonus creatures in the darkness. In Genesis 1 of the stars and the bonus creature in the seas of day five are the dragons. And as we're going to see right here in Isaiah, this is the star image. And then matching on the precise opposite end of this literary collection is the image of the dragon as well. So we start with the star. And once again, Isaiah is also drawing on a well known set of mythological motifs at work about this. Actually the word Isaiah uses morning star, son of the dawn. It's the phrase helel ben Shachar. Morning star is helel, sun is Ben, and then Shachar is dawn. The word dawn is an actual deity in Canaanite literature and mythology. The sunrise. So that's how this collection begins, depicting the downfall of a rebel star. Yeah, let's turn to the opposite end of this collection. In Isaiah, it's 24 through 27. Sometimes this collection is called the Isaiah Apocalypse. It's a wild. It's such a cool literary unit. And it is riddled, like packed packed packed with hyperlinks to Genesis 1 through 11.

It was all like a bundle bundled together for them. Whereas for us, we tend to separate natural evil and moral evil and sickness and mental illness and spiritual evil. These are all separated for many of us, and they weren't in this way of viewing the world. They were all manifestations of something deeply wrong in an interconnected way. And I think that's what the dragon slaying story provides. We're just going to keep working in different dragon text in the Hebrew Bible.
