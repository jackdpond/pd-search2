So I guess it probably really wasn't until I had started taking a class on biblical literature or on Old Testament theology, the prominence of this figure of Lady Wisdom really became clear to me. But she's a major character in the opening chapters of Proverbs. Actually, the poems connected to Lady Wisdom and Proverbs 8 is the kind of climactic speech of this figure in the opening chapters of Proverbs. And this chapter is saturated in both creation language and hyperlinks back to Genesis 1, but also to all kinds of other things that are fascinating. And this chapter was a major resource for the apostles too, when they were trying to use scriptural language and categories to talk about who Jesus was as both human and like, more than human, but actually like the God, God of Israel come among them. And so Proverbs 8 ends up having this huge influence in the Gospel of John, in the letter to the Hebrews, in Paul's letters. So pays off to put in some time with Proverbs 8. Kind of the whole Bible starts to unlock in pretty cool ways.",

    "text": "Yeah. The Hebrew Bible has actually a sophisticated way of talking, talking about the nature and being of the one God. The story of the Bible is all about. And these attributes of God, they don't summarize the totality of the divine essence in all of its, you know, infinite variety, but it is genuinely a manifestation, a character trait of the divine. And so we kind of lack categories for it. But these personified attributes of God, they are divine, and yet humans can experience them as their own entity, distinct from, but also one with God. And it's hard for me as a follower of Jesus, not to use the language given to me eventually by the apostles and then the Nicene Creed and Trinitarian categories, because that's where it all went. But the seedbed of this language was right here in the Book of Proverbs. So actually we're already getting to, like, the deep end of the pool by the time you get to the end of Proverbs 8. So let's first just kind of back up. Let's spend a few minutes. I'd like to just make some observations about actually just the macro literary design of Proverbs that has some illuminating things for us to see about this character of Lady Wisdom set. The Book of Proverbs in the Hebrew Bible, how that all fits together. But you guys are going to have to force me not to take like a whole half hour to do just that. But I think it's just helpful for thinking about who lady wisdom is and why she sits alongside the voice of a royal father and those two voices that dominate the landscape of the early part of Proverbs. We'll get some macro setting, then we'll dive in and read Proverbs 8 together. Does that sound good, you guys?",

    "text": "Sweet. SA all right. When we think about the whole book of Proverbs, different scholars have tried to discern the organizational structures at work in the book as a whole. It's actually fairly debated, mostly because the literary structure of the book as a whole really depends on what you're looking for or what you think is most prominent. So I'm most persuaded that the mention of Solomon in the book is kind of the key macro structural feature. And when you look at the mention of Solomon, you find his name appears at three prominent points that I think are the organizational kind of hinges for the three big blocks of it. So that's the speeches of chapters one through nine. It's all these long speeches. There aren't any little two line, little clever proverbs in the first chunk, which is chapters one through nine. And that chunk begins the Proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, the king of Israel. The next big chunk starts in chapter 10, and it repeats the heading again. It says the Proverbs of Solomon.",

And we're told that in Hezekiah's day, there was another recollection or a new collection made of Proverbs of Solomon. And that begins the third main section of the book. What's fascinating is that more Proverbs of Solomon go through 25 through 29. And then at the end of the book, chapter 30 and chapter 31 are collections of proverbs and speeches from two other people that are not. Solomon explicitly says it. So chapter 30 is called the Words of Agur. Nobody knows who he is, but it's a great name.",

  {
    "text": "Yeah, or you could say that. What's going on in these two. The words of Agur and the words of King Lemuel, both of them are testaments of wisdom that seems to stand outside of the line of Israel's kings, because Agur is a king, but. But he's not an Israelite king that's ever mentioned anywhere in the Old Testament. It kind of affirms something that we're going to see. Lady Wisdom says all the way back in. What we're going to see is anywhere you see a king or a ruler being wise, living wisely, and leading with wisdom and justice, they are, even if they don't know it, living by divine wisdom. And so it's as if that thing that Lady Wisdom said back in chapter eight gets a whole demonstration in the final chapter of the book. Final chapter of the book also has the epic poem about the wise Woman, the Proverbs 31 woman, which I know has a whole history attached to it, depending on what Christian tradition you're part of. But that wise woman is an embodiment of all the vocabulary and ideas of Lady Wisdom throughout the speeches in chapters one through nine. So it's as if Lady Wisdom is both a bookend for the speeches at the beginning and the speeches that end the book. So there's a lot more to do here, but it's just to say the whole book actually has a really cohesive organization. And you can kind of see the main themes emerging here. We have men and Women who are living by the wisdom of God, they become these like supercharged, superhuman versions of themselves because they're tapping into God's own divine wisdom, which has both male and female aspects to it, with Solomon and Lady Wisdom in the first big block, and then Lemuel and the wise woman that he sings about in his poem. So I've just always thought this is so cool. It just has a different set of emphases and a different way of talking about it than anywhere else in the Hebrew Bible. It's super cool.",

Because I had a big paradigm shift about the function of these books in the Hebrew Bible. Solomon is an Adam figure. If you look at the portrait of him, he's another one of these new humans who steps up to the plate to live by God's wisdom and bring the blessing of God to others. And he fails precisely because of his. Well, his own folly and greed for power. And then by listening to the voice of his non Israelite wives who seduce him into idolatry. And so right there, Solomon and his wives, they're an image of the Adam and Eve story of the Fall narrative in the Garden, but with the volume up to 11. So you have the greedy, power hungry man and you have this portrait in Kings of Solomon's seductive queen like wives. And together they become this portrait of corrupted wisdom that leads to slavery and death and ultimately exile. And so I think Proverbs is picking up on these archetypes.",

Let's get rich and rob the poor and strip them of their clothes, and we'll get plunder and booty and so on. It sounds like Solomon on the bad narratives you know about him.

It's a clearing your throat word on multiple fronts, but it's the actual word to like carve or etch out. And it's the standard Hebrew word used to refer to decrees or when leaders make a decision and then make it public. It's called often a chok or chukkot. And it refers to the practice of like the Ten Commandments. Carving. Yeah, carving a law or carving a decision into stone and then displaying it publicly. And so that carving is Key. Because Yahweh himself is going to be shown to use this carving skill to bring justice and order later on in the poem. But for right now, it's just important to kind of note that's the metaphor being used here, carving. Because when you carve a law, you're bringing order to a situation. Oh, man.

He says the Lord is depicted as procreator who also brought forth wisdom. The metaphor brought me forth signifies that in the narrative of the book, Solomon's inspired wisdom. Right. It's the Father's wisdom and then Lady Wisdom, but it comes from God's own essential being. So Solomon is depending himself on God's wisdom, which is depicted as the lady wisdom. So Watke goes on, it's a revelation that has an organic connection to God's very nature and being, unlike the rest of creation that came into existence outside of God and independent of his being. So it's just saying in biblical thought, you have God and then you have what is not God, that is creation. And what's the relationship between the two? And it's wisdom. Wisdom is what emerges from God birth and then orders and brings forth what is not. God. And so here I am, a little creature that's not God, but I'm given this personal connection to the very being of God, that is through wisdom. And he's saying that it's a way of talking about something that is both distinct from God and also God. Again, this chapter is the seedbed of the categories that will give birth to trinitarian thought after the time of Jesus. Certainly this isn't all the birth imagery is doing, but for sure it's one big part of it.",

Or is Jesus an eternal divine being who's a part of God's own identity? And Arius appealed to this very paragraph to say that the preincarnate Messiah was the first of God's identity creations because he's God's divine wisdom. So this is a charged question in many ways. So the Hebrew word, it gets translated in different ways. Verse 30. Sometimes it's translated, I was a craftsman beside him, or with him, or an artisan. The Hebrew word is Amon. Amon and it's not a common word. It's maybe used in one other place, but it's all about what root does it come from? And people debate these things. So New American Standard ESV translates it as master worker. So it's depicting wisdom as like the tool or the contractor that God uses to make the cosmos. The word also appears a couple times, or a different form of the word appears to describe someone, a nursling or a young child who is being brought up or raised up by someone. And that's what the King James chose way back when. And so it translates then I was by him as one brought up with the him.

Because the birth imagery is so strong in the context of God bringing forth one, but the one that he's bringing forth isn't something that God creates. Wisdom is essential to God's own very being. So the birth imagery I think is metaphorical because it's about the birthing of creation. And so creation emerges from God as he carves and creates. But the idea of a being who is distinct from, but unified with the key image in the Hebrew Bible, for that is the parent and the child, the father and the son, the mother and the daughter.

These are metaphorical ways of trying to say something that we don't have categories for, which is wisdom is so a part of God's essence and nature. But it's only one part, it's not the whole part. God is also all kinds of other things too. But that wisdom is a part through which God has reached out to create and interact with what is not God, that is his creatures. God wants his own creatures to participate in that wisdom and share in that divine wisdom. And so it goes out from God, what are metaphors that can do that? Birthing children, speaking. And these are metaphors to describe the relationship of God and God's wisdom. And it makes all the sense in the world.

I use bibleproject for the purpose of how to apply the words of God in my everyday life and live it out. My favorite thing about bibleproject is how you guys take the event that happened in the Old and New Testament, make them into a short animated video so that people could have better understanding of the entire story. We believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus. We are a crowdfunded project by people like me find free videos, study notes, podcasts, classes and more@bibleproject.com.",
