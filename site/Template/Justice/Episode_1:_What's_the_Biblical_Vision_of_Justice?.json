We have a new theme video on justice coming out on our YouTube channel soon. And so these conversations are Tim and I talking through the theme of justice and righteousness, how it weaves through the biblical story. This is a very important and timely conversation. This is also a very convicting conversation, but at the same time a really exciting and empowering conversation for those who follow Jesus. We'll look at how the theme of justice and righteousness weaves through the biblical story.",

In our culture today, every justice is a very fashionable word. It's a positive word that gets respect if you can claim to have justice on your side. But in our kind of modern Western culture, that comes out of these kind of Judeo Christian roots. It's an extremely confused conversation happening about what constitutes justice.",

It comes from a set of core values, usually religious values, a worldview that says these things in life are the ultimate goods or the ultimate values. So a helpful book that I was pointed to by Timothy Keller, who wrote an excellent book on a Christian vision of justice called Generous Justice. And in it, right at the beginning, he quoted from this Harvard Law professor who wrote this book that was excellent. His name is Michael Sandel, and it's called what's the Right Thing to Do? You. And Sandel's not a Christian? Well, actually, he might be. I don't know. I haven't looked up his Wikipedia page. But he's not writing as a Christian for Christians. He's trying to identify the fact that America and the west, modern West Europe too, lives in this really confused state where we all say liberty and justice, but we have subcultures that have totally different core values that define what the just thing is. And he boils them down to three that I found are helpful. And this is helpful for understanding what's going on in the Bible with justice. That's why I'm bringing this up. Okay, so he says there's a whole group and subculture with political parties attached that their core value in defining what is straight or just. He calls it the maximizing welfare view. So the straight action, the just action, is whatever will bring the greatest amount of good and reduce the greatest harm for the greatest number of people. But as a core principle, if the core is whatever reduces harm and increases flourishing for the greatest number of people, if that's your guide, that does get you going in a direction that will make life good for many people. But what that core value doesn't do is Help you determine what is the greatest good and what defines harm. Like, you have to define that.",

Everybody's supposed to have their own piece of land that they can work and develop and cultivate to provide for themselves and to contribute to their community, which seems very fair. It's very fair, yeah. In the Old Testament story, the land boundaries and it's like the ideal state where everybody has the chance to work hard and contribute. But as the kingdom period went on, it's just what naturally happens, just like what happens at Tinker Creek, is there's certain individuals begin to accumulate through fair or unfair means, more resources, more land. And what Micah identifies is there's people who are changing the boundary lines at nighttime, or there's people who are buying land from lower income landowners and then slowly turning them into bond servants or slaves, or they rig the weight systems in the markets so that wheat is, you know, it's whatever.

The Levites were grounds and maintenance and facilities for the temple. For the temple and then one tribe within Levi with actual groups from the line of Aaron and Zadok and so on. So all of the tribes were to donate a tenth or a tithe of their field produce and animals. So this is where the word tithe comes from. What's interesting is multiple places. Here's just one example. In Deuteronomy chapter 18, it's talking about all of the other tribes giving a tenth of their income to the Levites. This temple tax is called the Levites mishpat. It's the mishpat of the Levites. Now it makes no sense to translate that word justice there. It's the justice of the Levites. What are we talking about? So we're talking about they have arranged their society so that the right and good thing is to have one whole group of people that's supported by the income of the other tribes. To maintain the worship and the honor of God in the temple. And so we have decided that the Levites have a right, a mishpat, a right to one tenth of the income of all the other tribes. They create that. And to not do that then is to do injustice. It's to violate their rights. So this is what's at the core of this meaning of restorative justice is that there are these certain people who have unique rights. And so we as an Israelite society need to be aware of who these unique people are because their rights could be easily neglected. So think about it. You know, these Levites, these guys aren't working the land. They could starve if the rest of the tribes don't respect their, their mishpat, their God given right.",

If you read through the poetry of the Psalms, a huge number of appearances of this word mishpat are actually aren't describing what humans do. It's describing who God is and God's character and what God does. And actually all of it is rooted in the story of the Exodus. So the justice video, thinking to the video. The Exodus will play a big, big part of this, of the storyline. So you get a poem like this, Psalm 146, the Lord God, the one who uphold mishpat for the oppressed. What does it mean for God to seek mishpat for the oppressed? He gives food to the hungry. He sets prisoners free. He opens the eyes of the blind. He raises up those who are bowed down. He loves the righteous. He protects the immigrant. He supports the fatherless and the widow, and he thwarts the way of the wicked. This is when God shows up and does mishpat. These are the kinds of things that happen to me, it's just interesting. Like, there are some things. He thwarts the way of the wicked, takes them to the courtroom, finds them, punishes them. We think, yes, all right, justice. He supports the fatherless and the widow. So that, like what we just talked about, advocacy, protecting the rights of.
