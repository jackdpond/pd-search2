Just like parents will establish guidelines for how we work as a family in our house, we don't yell at each other. We say, please, we share a thing. You know, like, those are rules. And it would be totally missing the point to be like, how legalistic, you know, the point is you love this thing and you want to honor it precisely by protecting it. So in all these different ways, different Jewish traditions develop different types of guidelines for what constitutes work. But the whole thing was, there's something beautiful here.

But the word Shabbat, its basic meaning is to cease from. To stop. I am not strictly, I'm not Shabbat observant in any kind of strict way.

Like after the Hebrew Bible period, it kept developing for another 20 centuries. So maybe one helpful distinction to make as we begin. A lot of people love to learn and talk about the Shabbat because they're really interested in the practice of it, like the Friday night to Saturday night practice and why and what that means. Our conversation is going to be a little bit different of a focus. And the video will be different in that if you go to the Hebrew Scriptures, you have to wait 80 chapters in the whole book of Genesis and then half of the book of Exodus, you don't get a command about observing the Sabbath until Exodus chapter 20. So that's 70 chapters in really bad math. So think about that. If the Bible is designed to give the people of Israel a handbook on how to observe Shabbat, it's kind of a weird one because it doesn't even get to it. 70 chapters. And then what's interesting, and we'll look. The Sabbath commands in the Torah are differently worded. And they give different reasons about why they practice the Sabbath.",

The video won't be about practicing the practice as such. We'll get there in the video and in our conversations. But it's a governing theological idea about the concept of time in the Bible.

    "text": "Totally. We're already to it right here. The seventh day is like a multifaceted gem. And as the concept develops through the story of the Bible, we're going to discover in different story after story that there's going to be different ways and angles and facets that get you to the core. One of the main facets is the fabric of creation as leading towards a great goal where humans imitate God and join him in ceasing from work and labor. But there's going to be another facet that's all about being enslaved to our labor and slaves to something. And so the seventh day is the time to celebrate our liberation from slavery so that we can rest with God. And actually both of these themes are in Genesis 1:3. Genesis 1:3 is where you find both of them developed. And then it's like from there you get two strands, two chords. Like think of a symphony and one will be the creation and all history leading up to the seventh day. Another one will be. The seventh day is about liberation from slavery to rest in an Eden like state. But they're both really about the same thing. And you can see it. This is why I like the two expressions of the Ten Commandments. Exodus 20 gives you the creation. Imitate God, participate with him in the seventh day. Deuteronomy 5 gives you the liberation from slavery. You're celebrating liberation from slavery every seventh day in anticipation of some future, a full liberation. That's right. And those two ideas are both ways of thinking about the meaning of the seventh day. It's like Genesis 1:3 will introduce these two facets of Sabbath, and then the rest of the storyline of the Bible is like a symphony, just going to riff and weave them with different stories and different themes and so on.",

He is cluing into this phrase that's repeated in both Sabbath commands. This phrase in English, it gets rendered. The seventh day is a Sabbath of Yahweh. In Hebrew, the phrase is Shabbat le Adonai, a Sabbath to Yahweh. One day out of seven, the Israelite is to renounce dominion over his own time and recognize God's dominion over it. Simply put, every seventh day, the Israelite renounces his autonomy and affirms God's dominion over him. In conclusion, every seventh day, the Israelite renounces dominion over his time, renounces autonomy, recognizes God's dominion over time, and thus over himself. His conclusion, keeping the Sabbath is an acceptance of the kingdom and sovereignty of God. I like the way he puts that so well. Yeah, you tell me what you're hearing and the significance of it.",

This is why everybody's bustling around in the market at 4pm it's inconvenient on purpose on Friday. It's intentionally inconveniencing your life. And the structure reminds you there's something bigger going on. And I have to adjust my life to it. And Matas Yahoo's way of saying it is. It's the kingdom of God.
