It is the firstborn's duty to provide and protect for the family. It's their responsibility to represent the family and to stand or fall for the family. I see these duties all through scripture, and since I'm in the middle of a sermon series on Passover, the duty of the firstborn is to represent the family in punishment and in need for redemption. And that's really strong in that story. So Tim's work on these themes seem to be all about privilege and status, while not following through on the expectations of who gets the right of the firstborn in terms of duty.

But at the same time, I know we have. At least I've tried to name. At least I think I did name. The responsibility is a really big part of this. But maybe it's our own cultural location where my mind specifically goes to power and privilege, which is a thing in the biblical story. Like, very much so. Especially when you have figures like a ham who are trying to get into the position of the firstborn, the ham pattern that we called it in the series. Or like David's sons, like, in the beginning of 1, kings are all jockeying for who gets to be in the position of king. So the goal is they want to be responsible, but it's for sure about power and being the first one. So I think more. It's probably just. I am overemphasizing the power and privilege theme. But you're absolutely right. Like, the representation of the whole family having duty and responsibility is for sure a core part of this theme as well. So it kind of wraps together all those things. So I'm not sure anything needs to get reconciled. I think more it's. We could probably go through all the stories we went through and have paid more attention to the duty or responsibility theme.",

Okay, there were a lot, like, a lot of questions sent in, so as always, we're probably only going to get through a few.

Question is about Adam and Eve and in the Garden of Eden story, how Adam is created from the dirt first in the narrative, and then the woman is created from the side of the Adam second later in the story. And so there were lots of questions about, well, if the order of the firstborn is so crucial in where the biblical story goes from here, are we meant to meditate back on that relationship and see the role?",

So that's the typical pattern. The question is that happens with Cain and Abel all the way throughout. How am I supposed to understand the story about the man and the woman in the garden then? And what I would think is if the man and the woman fits the pattern, the latecomer is the woman in the story. And so am I supposed to see her as elevated in a special way over and against the man?",

So these are really big topics in complex texts. So we don't. This would take many episodes to sort out all the pieces. But let's for the moment, just observe in the Garden of Eden story.

So it's when the singular human receives the command, then you get the sleep and the division of the man and woman. Then when Genesis 3 begins, the snake comes to the woman at the tree. And when the snake says, you know, Did God really say, you know, you shouldn't eat from any tree of the garden? What she says is, oh, no, we can eat from all the trees of the garden. There's just that one in the center that God said, don't eat from it and you shall not touch it. And you're like, what? God said that? Yeah. So it's weird because she repeats God's command, but in this kind of misshapen way, in incorrect way. So what that creates is an opportunity. Implicit in the story is to say, well, if Eve knows about the divine command, it's only because her husband told her. But it seems like he didn't tell her in a very good way because it's like a distorted version of the command. At least you can put together that set of ideas from just a face value reading of the story. And almost certainly that's the little set of details Paul is drawing attention to in 1 Timothy 2.",

Paul's words don't really reflect on or make a comment on the whole role of responsibility, authority, and firstborn and who's the first and who's the second?

But he has an excellent discussion of First Timothy in its historical and cultural context and in the literary context of the whole letter. I've learned so much from his books. He also has a number of books on women in ancient Judaism, Women in the time of Jesus, and women in the New Testament Letters. He's awesome. Also, Lucy Pepyat, a theologian that has written on these things and who we had here at Bibleproject to teach a class on 1 Corinthians she's done a lot of work on the role of women in Paul's letters and in the Corinthian letters specifically. So in her book Rediscovering Scripture's Vision for Women, she has a really great discussion about Both Genesis, about 1 Timothy, chapter 2. So those are places to go if you want to dive deeper.",

Thank you again for everything that you do. Yeah, great question. Excellent, excellent question. Yeah, man. That narrative in Genesis 48, you just. You should know the narrator is just winking at you, the reader, the whole time. Like, in terms of narrative patterning and hyperlinks. So in one sense, remember who Jacob is. Jacob is the second born. The second born who from birth was clawing at the position of the firstborn, famously grabbing at the heel of his brother from the beginning. And then, not just that, but then he and his mom, you know, are in cahoots trying to get him that position. And that's the whole thing about tricking and deceiving Isaac with the food and all of that. So in essence, what you see Jacob doing here is replaying for the next generation what he had been doing when he came out of the womb, which is usurping and reversing the order of the first and the second born. So that's just interesting. It's like here we have Jacob as an old man repeating for his grandsons what he did to his brother earlier on in the story. So that's one piece. Another piece are these are Joseph's two sons. So these are half Israelite, half Egyptian boys, because Joseph married an Egyptian woman, Asenath, and he's adopting these two sons as his own sons. And this is why Manasseh and Ephraim are named among the sons of Jacob. As you go on for the story from here, what's interesting is that Ephraim is the second born, but he swaps his hands to make him the firstborn. And it has to be relevant that Ephraim's name comes from the Hebrew root to be fruitful and multiply fruit. So his name is fruit. Double fruit, Ephraim. So he's got the double fruit. So he elevates the second born, whose name is double fruit, to be in the firstborn. And. And then what's interesting is the word for when he crosses his hands, the Hebrew word sekel. But it's a wordplay, a homonym for the same Hebrew root for what the woman sees. The tree is good for gaining wisdom. It's from a related root. So what's happening at that moment is the woman is doing what's good in her own eyes, and she sees that the tree is good for Haskiel, and she takes from the tree. And so, in a similar way here. Now, here's Jacob repeating what was good in his eyes from an infant all the way up to him being an old man. And it's like he's up to his old tricks again. He's up to his old tricks.",

So, yes, yes and yes. To have the firstborn son of the first king come to David, who was the last born son, bring him out in a field elevated over all of his brothers already. Yeah. So there's already like David is the late comer's eighth born, who gets put in the position of the firstborn. And now Saul is being like Cain to David. And you would think, oh, well, if this is the firstborn of Saul, it's going to be even worse. And so 1st Samuel 20 is riddled with the language from the Cain and Abel story, but all to invert it and it's super, super cool. And there's this cool thing where they work out a. A signal where David go hiding behind that rock. And if my dad says this, then I'll have my assistant fire three arrows. Three. It's all about a test of Jonathan's loyalty to David. And then he goes out to the rock and instead of murdering him in the field, he actually says, I know that you're going to become my king. Super, super clever inversion of all of this. So, yes, way to go, Garrett. So the principle there is you're so many layers deep into the cycle of this theme that the biblical authors can just pull select vocabulary from earlier cycles of the theme. And the point, like you're using this language of. Is Jonathan an anti Cain and an anti Saul? So biblical authors are constantly wanting to help you understand what's happening by inviting you to compare a character or a moment to earlier characters or moments. And this is what hyperlinks are. And so you're supposed to both contrast Jonathan and his dad, Saul. And that's a whole set of hyperlink comparisons. But then also both of them are set on analogy and contrast to Cain in important ways too. And we're getting even more. Psalm 1. How does this qualify for you? Is this nerdy?

That is God and was with God and that is the light shining in the darkness. And then the culmination of that opening part of John is. And the Word became flesh or took on flesh. So it imitates the Word and light first, Human Last John 1, Word and Light first becomes human at the conclusion. So that's a great observation. But what's interesting is in Genesis 1, the Word and the light is God's. God's word and God's light. And then the humans are in image of God, so they're not God, but they are in image of God.

And John is going to make those implicit ideas explicit when he's going to talk about the Word, God's Word being Both God and with God that is somehow distinct as a thing that goes out from God. And there, when he means with God, he's going to map on God and the Word to Father and the Son, that the Father is the one who sends out the Son. Okay, so the Word and light are not created, but what they do bring about is the environment, the cosmos in which humans are called to be an image of God. And John 1 hits replay on all of that, but makes what was implicit in Genesis explicit. The God and the Word are two distinct persons within the one God. And then he's going to ramp it up, even and say, and the Word and that light sent out from God became human. So now the human image of God is God and the one who is with God.",

And so he anticipates a day when God's Word and command is written on the heart, God's covenant partners, so that no Israelite has to say to their neighbor, hey, you know, let me teach you how to know Yahweh. Because he says, they will all know me and John. In the Gospel of John, when Jesus says in John 17, this is eternal life, that they know you and me. So it, it really is the way that humans are brought in to that eternal communion of love between Father and Son is by allowing God's love and wisdom to be written on our hearts to bring us into union with the Father through the Son empowered by the Spirit.

It's interesting the volumes really turned up on this in Luke because the stories of Zechariah, John's dad, Zechariah and Elizabeth, and the story of Mary and the angels that sent to them, what the angels say, how they respond to the angels, the timing of the birth, it's all set up really closely as a comparison, which leads the reader to wonder what the comparison will be between John and Jesus. In other words, the gospel authors themselves really elaborate and build up on the comparison between the two. So when you come across what John says, John the Baptist says in the Gospel of John. So In John chapter one, verse 15, it's John testifying about Jesus and he says, ah, this is the one of whom I said, the one who comes after me. He is before me because he was before me. So this before and after language here, so he's technically born after me, but he is before me in status or rank because he was before me. And it's a wordplay on the divine name. I am, he was, I am. So Jesus will say later, he'll echo the divine Name with the 7 I AM statements in John. And what John is saying here, he's playing on that, but putting in past tense to say he was before me even though he came after me. It's like a little riddle.",
