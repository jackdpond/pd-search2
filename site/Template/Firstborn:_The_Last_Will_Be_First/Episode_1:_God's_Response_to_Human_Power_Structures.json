So he goes through the code of Hammurabi, gives some examples, ancient Assyrian laws, legal like documents from all these ancient Near Eastern cities, Mari and Nusi and Alalaq. And what you find is there is a basic assumption, it's the same as the Hebrew Bible. There's a basic assumption that this practice of giving the firstborn son was the norm. But there were exceptions. And just like in the Hebrew Bible, there's a law addressing what if a dad wants to make an exception. I see there are also laws that do make exceptions also down in Egypt and Babylon and Assyria, but all the laws are usually little unique variations. So let's see, like in Egypt, he gives an example in Egypt, in the Middle Kingdom, the la primogenitur could be disregarded by a dying father. Property could be willed to a brother, for example. So here's, you know, maybe the firstborn son is like incompetent or maybe he died or who knows? We don't know.

Aaron has four sons, and the first two, in their first day on the job in the tabernacle, do violate protocol. And so God takes their lives and elevates the third born Eleazar to the place of the honored son. This happens with. My favorite place this motif gets explored is in the opening chapters of Samuel with the story of Hannah and the birth of Samuel, because Hannah is married to this guy named Elkanah, and Elkanah has another wife, Peninnah. And Peninnah has all these sons and is able to produce fruit of the womb, but Hannah cannot. But interestingly, Elkanah loves Hannah more, but Peninnah has the place of social prominence in the family because she can produce children. And so the whole story is about how God chooses and elevates and gives a special gift to Hannah over and above Peninnah. And then that is the gift of Samuel, her son, who she surrenders over to become a Nazirite to like a virtual high priest. And he lives in and around the temple. And then the actual high priest at the time, Eli, has these older sons who were like terrible guys. And God elevates the little Samuel, the little boy Samuel, who's not even the Levite. Yeah.

So Samuel goes to his house, and he has Jesse line up all his sons. This is great. First Samuel, 16, 6. And when the sons came, Samuel looked upon Eliab, the firstborn, and he thought, oh, surely the Lord's anointed one is now before the Lord. But the Lord said to Samuel, don't look upon his appearance. Don't look at the height of his stature. Because this guy, Eliav, not the guy. Not the guy. For the Lord does not see as humans see. Humans look on the appearance of the outside, but the Lord looks on the heart. So then Jesse says, okay, second born, come on up. Abinadab. He makes impasse before Samuel. And Samuel says, nope, this is classic storytelling here now. Totally. Then Jesse made thirdborn Shammah pass by. Nope. Samuel says, jesse made seven sons, passed before Samuel.

I think what's interesting is that with all of this emphasis in the New Testament saying Jesus holds the place and status of the eternal firstborn within the very being of God, the community that is the one God, Father, Son and Spirit. The puzzle is you would think that God is anti this institution or practice of just because the firstborn son has that role inherently, that son deserves the right to have power and authority. But then the whole claim about Jesus is he actually is the legitimate holds, legitimately out of all the humans in the story, right here is the one who can truly legitimately be called the firstborn. Because he actually is the firstborn. He actually is the son of God.",

He's from a, you know, rural hill country up in Galilee, from sticktown, Nazareth. He is not trained in Jerusalem. He's not a Bible scholar with traditional credentials. So all of that is portraying Jesus as the outsider, the younger sibling, the one who holds a place of low social rank, and then being crucified as a criminal.",

God both subverts this pattern, but what he's subverting is not the idea that God should have a true representative son. What he's opposing is the way that humans try to scheme and create and get that power through a redefinition of good and bad. And so Jesus becomes like the model, the true model of what the legitimate firstborn is and should be, which is a model of humility and love and self giving compassion. Yeah, but it's just kind of this cool twist in the way the New Testament tells the story of Jesus. So that's kind of the big picture.",

The humans are the latecomers, the dirt creatures less glorious than the spiritual beings above, but it's the humans who are given authority to rule.",
