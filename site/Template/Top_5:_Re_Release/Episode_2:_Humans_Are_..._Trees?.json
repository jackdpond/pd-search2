It's not nerdy academic, but he's really sharp and he's done a lot of work on treason in the Bible. So it's kind of like an overview of trees throughout the storyline in the Bible. So there's some overlap with what we're doing, and just really creative. But he's also. He has a background in the sciences, and so there's all these biblical meditations, but then scientific meditations on trees, the nature of trees, and the nature of human and tree interdependence. It's fascinating. So in the course of conversation, I'll bring up a couple things that he brought to my attention that were kind of cool.

To my attention by Hebrew Bible scholar David Andrew Teeter, was that if you take a class or look at any introduction to reading biblical poetry or listen to our conversations on biblical poetry, the main design convention of biblical poetry is two or three short lines that are parallel, designed to be paired together in some way, repeating either the same ideas or vocabulary, but never identical, always with a little bit of variation that you think of them as one combined associated idea. But the differences enrich it, give it greater depth and metaphorical comparison. And it's that same principle, but here in a narrative, where certain elements of a narrative are paired. In poetry, you can do it in two short lines. Here in narrative, it's through literary structure and design. So the bonus act on two paired days is fruitful trees and fruitful humans.

So Psalm 1's just somebody who really thought for a long time about Genesis 1 and 2, or it's written from the imagination of somebody soaked in Genesis 1 and 2. People are trees. So this was really helpful for me. Yeah, that's really interesting because this will pay dividends as you go into the rest of the Bible of sorting out tree imagery and why it occurs so often. Why a man who claims in word and deed to be the creator hanging upon a tree can give the gift of God's own life and spirit to the rest of creation.
