And on the seventh day he stopped and he settled into his creation to rest and rule with his human partners in a day that has no end. The seventh day rest is what we all long for, and it's what God promises to recreate. And to start this recreation project, he chooses one family, the family of Abraham, and he wants to give them the rest that was lost and let them bring that rest to the whole world. So today on this episode, we're going to look at Israel's sacred days, their feasts and festivals and surprise, there's seven of them.",

So it's detached from human manipulation. So it's every seven years the debts are released and then go down to verse 12. Now if your kinsman, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, then the maximum he can serve is six years. And in the seventh year, you shall send him out. That verb, send out, it's what? It's the key repeated motif in the Exodus story. Let my people go means to send out yeah, Let them be sent out. Let them go. And get this, when you set free your slave in the seventh year, don't send him away, him or her away empty handed. Furnish him liberally from your flock and threshing floor from your wine vat. Give to him as Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall remember you were a slave in the land of Egypt and Yahweh your God redeemed you. Therefore I command you to do this day. So every seventh year both the land gets released. Now you have these cycles of every seventh year, debts are released. Debts were a common way that people became slaves. Can't pay the debt. So then I work it off. I become the property of the person who I owe something until I work it off. And so there's more laws and clarifications. Like if you see the seventh year coming.

So it might help just to look at the list, there are six appointed times in the rest of the chapter divided into two groups of three. That sounds familiar. That sounds like days one through six of Genesis. And they're precisely the ones that come in the first six months. You get three.",

I love every video that I've watched so far. I use the Bible Project to help illuminate things that I don't quite understand and just get a reference for the Bible. My favorite thing about the Bible Project is the Thing videos. My favorite video so far has been the one on Justice. We believe that the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus. We're a crowdfunded project by people like me. Free videos, study notes, podcasts, and more. You can find them@thebibleproject.com.",
