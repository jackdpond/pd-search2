    "text": "Hey, this is John at the bibleproject. And today Tim and I are going to finish up a series that we've been calling Seventh Day Rest. This has been a really long series, and if you're just jumping in, I recommend you start from the beginning. But if you're not gonna. Here's a quick recap on page one of the Bible. God brings order to the universe in a series of six days. And on the seventh day, he stops and he enters his creation like a king entering a temple to rest and rule. And God creates humans, calls the humans his image, and tells them to rest and rule with him in his creation. And this vision of rest on the seventh day is a hope that ancient Israel took seriously. In fact, one of the ten Commandments is to stop what? Working on the seventh day, or in Hebrew, Shabbat, and practice rest. And it wasn't just this one day. There's actually seven sacred festivals that all help ancient Israel remember who they are and where this story is heading. Each festival a way to practice now what we hope for in the future. A time of unending restful reign with God in his good creation. And there's more. Every seventh year, there's a whole year devoted to rest. And every seventh seven years, there's a culminating event called the year of Jubilee, where all debts are forgiven, slaves are freed. It's the ultimate rest. In the last two episodes, we looked at how Jesus saw himself as the one bringing this ultimate rest. He claimed that the real year of jubilee, the one that all of these festivals and practices are anticipating, that that reality is coming with him, that he is the Lord of the Sabbath. This claim, amongst others, got Jesus killed. But the Gospels claim that Jesus laid in the tomb resting on the Sabbath. And on the first day of a new week, he rose from the dead. And that power that brought Jesus back from the dead is available to us. God's spirit can live in us. And God's spirit is a sign that we, too, are destined for ultimate rest. And so now we come to our last stop in this series. While Jesus brought ultimate rest, it has yet to come fully. We still find ourselves in a world of strife and struggle. And so in this episode, we want to look at a passage in the book of Hebrews that brings these ideas full circle. We're going to look at Hebrews, chapters three and four. But here's a key verse in four, verse nine. There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God. For anyone who enters, God's rest also rests from their work. Just as God did from his. And let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest.",

It's that the weekly practice of the Sabbath, along with all the laws of the covenant, but especially the poignant ones in their cultural context, Kosher food laws, circumcision of males, and Sabbath, those were the most visible boundary line creating that set off the people of Israel from their neighbors. And so when Sabbath comes up in the letters of Paul, it's because there are messianic Jews, not all of them, but at least some, who are making it a requirement to be a part of the family of Jesus, that that's the circumstance that compels him to. And his point is, listen, the Torah of Moses played a crucially important role for the time that it was the thing that God was doing in and through Israel. But now, through the death and resurrection of the Messiah, the family of Abraham, as it always was intended to be, now consists of many nations, not just one. And so those markers don't define the identity of God's people anymore. That's why then Paul says, if you want to honor Jesus through observance of the Sabbath, do that, do that.

Right. With Cornelius and the food. Yeah. That the cultural forms and practices that this movement is going to take will always be developing and changing in their shape and form because by nature encompassing all of humanity and all of its diversity.

It doesn't discount or dishonor the traditions that have come before. You're foolish to ignore them, but it doesn't mean you have to repeat them. And I'm just talking here about the rhythms, cultural forms of how you practice certain things in the Christian tradition. So here's what's tricky is that it's precisely the way that people practice these kinds of traditions and take out Sabbath, you know, and insert baptism or the Lord's Supper or whatever.

It's an edited collection by Donald Carson, DA Carson, called From Sabbath to Lord's Day. It's the most. It's maybe like 20 essays and they're all like 40 pages long. It's a massive book. But from everything from ancient Israel to Hebrew Bible to Jewish Second Temple to New Testament to the early centuries of the church, they make the case that all the evidence points in that the Lord's day of the Sunday celebration was never a replacement for or viewed as a Christian Sabbath. Rather, it was viewed as the new thing, the new creation day that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus and that many messianic communities continued in those first centuries to practice Shabbat and then they would also celebrate Jesus on the next day.",

If you think of the Sabbath, the weekly Sabbath, as distilling all of the themes of the seventh day rest theme in the Hebrew Bible, then in a way, the Resurrection Sunday, every single week you're celebrating what you really celebrate on Resurrection Sunday in the spring, like with Easter, for example.

In other words, if you're reading this in Greek, it's the name Jesus. And that's for sure. He's winking at you here. So if that previous Jesus had given them rest, why are we talking about another day in Psalm 95 and then verse 9? So I'm telling you, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. The implication is the risen Jesus, not the Jesus of the past, has opened up the Sabbath rest for the people of God. Anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his. So let's make every effort to enter into that rest. So, you know, this guy's all over the Old Testament scriptures, but he's drawing together these threads from Genesis 1, from the image of the promised land as a new Eden, ultimate seventh day rest from the wilderness narratives showing how Israel never attained that rest. And in this author's mind, that actually Summarizes the whole Old Testament story, even the whole monarchy, right with David and so on. He just dismisses as one long period of disobedience, which is how the prophets understood it too. And so he reads the Old Testament the way that the final shapers of the Tanakh did, which is that the ultimate rest has never yet happened to our people. Yet. But the one who's greater than Moses and greater than Joshua, Jesus has opened up that rest for us. You want to see something interesting? If you look in chapter 12 of Hebrews, he actually talks even more about how we have come to that rest. It's available in the present. Look at verse 22 of chapter 12. He says, you all have arrived at Mount Zion to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels and joyous assembly. That's the divine council to the assembly or the church. Ekklesia of the firstborn, whose names are all written in heaven.

This concept of worship, this is a whole new frontier for me that I'm reading deep into right now, as we get into apocalyptic, is that the temple liturgy of Israel's temple has had a fundamental influence on the history of concepts of worship right into Messianic Judaism and early Christianity. So that when the gathered people of God come together, it's as if they create on earth the mirror of the celebration happening in the new creation. Pick your metaphor. If you want to use spatial metaphors, it's in the heavenly Jerusalem. If you want to use time imagery, it's in the future, Rest. Yeah. But the point is, in the present, when God's people gather to bring their prayers and their joys and celebrate together in the name of Jesus, they are creating a bit of heaven on earth through worship. I think that's why he brings up. You've come essentially to the temple and are participating in angels and the souls of the righteous made perfect in a joyful assembly. He's describing like a day, a Sabbath day in the temple courts when the Levitical choirs are doing their thing. So I think that's what he's referring to here. So he or she really believes that when God's people are gathered in the power of the spirit, praising Jesus, that. And you bring all of the stuff in the week where you tried to love your neighbor and you tried to be aware of the hurting people around you, and you bring all those burdens and cares and joys into the weekly gathering, and you bring it all before Jesus alongside all these other people who are trying to follow Jesus, too, and you announce that he's the king of the universe, despite what everybody else says around us.

Back to that first conversations we have that in the history of Sabbath practice, one of the main things is by inconveniencing my life one day in a weekly rhythm, it reminds me that my time is not my own, but it's subject to the rule and reign of God. That's awesome. Like, I need to be reminded of that and the way and the rhythm, a cultural form that that takes will probably vary. Well, it has varied in the course of my own life and it probably will need to vary again. But that's a core idea. The idea that the ultimate reign and rule of God, which is what I hope for in the culmination of all creation, has already been launched and is already at work in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. So what does it mean for me to participate in that with my entire life, but then also to mark out rhythms of weekly moments where I can remind myself of that story. Because it's difficult to believe, at least for me, and I need rhythms to remind me of it. So those are things that could be expressed in lots of different forms, couldn't they? Yeah, I think. And I think that's what the apostles thought, which is why they made the decisions that they did at the Jerusalem Council, to which you and I stand indebted to as gentiles. Right. On the other side of the planet, 2,000 years later, we are directly affected by their decision. Right.",

How they're going to faithfully and rhythmically live out this vision of life and of the universe and of the hope for the seventh Day Rest. I think that. And I think that's what Paul. What we see Paul pushing his communities towards in the places where Sabbath became a controversy, whether in Galatia or in Colossae or in Rome. Yeah. Yeah. It's unfortunate that it's become such a point of controversy. Right. Sabbath practices. Because what it has always been meant to do is be create a space for freedom and creativity and hope. And I hope that's what these conversations and I really hope that's what the video can kind of invite people into.",
