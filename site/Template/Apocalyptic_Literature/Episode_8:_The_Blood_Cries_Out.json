There's a lot going on in the world, and while bibleproject's mission isn't to speak into current events, we found that we're in this really unique place talking about apocalyptic literature, literature that's supposed to open our eyes to what's really going on behind the veil, to see the world as God sees it. And we began this series talking about the pandemic and how that was a type of apocalypse that has opened our eyes to realities in the world. So we thought it would be amiss to not end this series with another apocalypse that's happening right in front of us. And we'll look through the Book of Revelation.",

    "text": "We recorded the main conversations about how to Read apocalyptic months, many months ago when we released them, it coincided with, you know, the, the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. So we did a special kind of real time episode to reflect on that. The pandemic, you know, from perspective of the biblical story. And then, you know, as we concluded the series, it coincides with another set of current events that I think equally qualify as another apocalypse happening to our culture. We recorded the last episode of those conversations, the Q and R episode of the apocalyptic on Tuesday, May 26, and George Floyd had been killed just 24 hours earlier. I remember reading about it in the news that morning when I was kind of beginning my work day and as you and I were recording the Q and R episode, the first protests were just forming that afternoon in Minneapolis. And so we're sitting here now. He was killed two weeks ago today. And man, what so hard to put into words what we're all experiencing. Everybody's experience is so multi layered, you know. So it seems to me that there's a number, another apocalypse taking place. Right. As we're closing down our series on how to read apocalyptic. And I just, I felt like we can't ignore another opportunity to reflect on how not just the murder of George Floyd, but right there's been this kind of recent litany of black people killed in situations that are rooted in racial injustice. And it's some kind of tipping point and it's an important moment that we need to reflect on. So that's the context. So this is just a special extra episode in the Apocalyptic series. And as I've been thinking about the book of Revelation, there's an important motif happening with the book of Revelation. John's depiction of Babylon and the fate of slaves and the fate of innocent blood in the book that I thought would be kind of give us a perspective on how to think about this with an apocalyptic set of lenses on.",

    "text": "Yeah, man, I think you're not alone in that. I think that's how a lot of people in America are feeling. I've also felt the full range of emotions. And neither you and I are given to a very wide range of emotions on an average day. I think you're right. There's something about the last 10 weeks of the coronavirus situation, whatever you call it, pandemic crisis, that has kind of removed a layer of, I don't know, of orderliness from our lives that I think makes a lot of people extra vulnerable to the intensity of these murders. You know, not just George, but Brianna Taylor and then Ahmad Arbery. All of these, they've just kind of stacked together in a short amount of time. And my parents were actually really invested back in the 90s, especially when I was a teenager. They intentionally wanted to understand more the experience of the black community here in Portland. And so they just. They started going to, like, an old traditional black church. And this is when I told them I didn't want to go to church anymore. And so they didn't. They didn't make me, but they did. And I remember there was a whole season, kind of my teen years, where they just cultivated lots of friendships with people in the African American community, and they just wanted to know the story of Portland, the way that black people have experienced Portland. And I remember really admiring my parents for that. And I can see now, you know, since I moved back to Portland after grad school and as an adult, I've just been aware of that reality of Portland, watching it change, watching the urban core gentrify and watching how the African American neighborhoods traditionally when I was growing up have all been turned into Trader Joe's and, you know, the apartment buildings and all transformed. And that's all just been happening. And it's like this example, this systemic thing that happens in the history of America. And it's just from what I understand, right from when I listen to my black brothers and sisters, it's just one more iteration of the thing that's been happening for centuries. That's their experience. And so for this all to come to the surface in the last couple weeks, I just have felt so sad. Despair. Despair that has turned into anger in as much as I experience anger consciously, which is not. It doesn't look much on the outside. At least that's what my wife tells me when I'm angry. You can hardly tell. And another part of it, too, is that I feel like, you know, I'm like a privileged white guy, you know, like, so who wants to listen to me talk about my despair and sadness? Like, who cares? I actually haven't had to live with a fear of policemen. From my earliest memories as a boy, the way my black friends share it with me about one important moment for me was when we started telling our boys, our little boys telling the story of George Floyd and Brianna Taylor and my youngest son. We were over the dinner table and my youngest son August, he actually, in the middle of the story, he asked me to stop. What he said was, I know what you're going to say happens that he dies. And he said it made him feel like he wasn't safe in his city anymore. And you know, I was watching him process that and I thought of a good friend, he's African American. And he was just sharing with me like last week what it's like to grow up with a fear of policemen from your earliest memories as a little black boy in Portland. And I was looking at my son, who's white, you know, and just to see that fear in his eyes that like what there are might be some police who aren't safe. And I was just watching. It was just a little bit of innocence dripping from him, you know. So anyway, the only thing I've known what to do with these emotions is I just started going to march in the non violent demonstrations in Portland and it's been really powerful and it felt so good to yell and we're just saying, we're. Say their names.",

It's a form of slavery. One of John's core metaphors is that the Revelation is a tale of two cities. There's the city that is ruled on Mount Zion, the heavenly Mount Zion, by the slain lamb who liberates people to become a kingdom of priests. And then there's the city of Babylon that enslaves people with its military and economy and lulls people into indifference. And this is the tale of two cities. So I thought this has been actually helpful for me in the last couple weeks, I thought we could kind of take a tour of this motif of the tale of two cities through Babylon and then maybe come back to this whole complex eruption of racial injustice in our culture and maybe look at it with some new eyes.",

    "text": "Okay, so maybe let's just kind of upload the last couple conversations you and I had, John, about viewing the Revelation as a set of glasses, lenses through which any audience, any generation, including the first readers, but now to 21st century readers living anywhere, a set of glasses that you put on to try and understand and interpret your own landscape, the religious, political landscape of any given church community. So we explored that approach in the last couple episodes and how that differs from viewing the Revelation as a predictive code that is pointing to just one set of events in the past or the future, that kind of thing. So this is an exercise in viewing the Revelation as a set of lenses as we think about this motif of the. Of the two cities. Okay, so let's start in chapter one. We just talked about this briefly, but I realize I never clarified what I meant by it. But in chapter one, where John is exiled, we're introduced to the visionary of the book. Chapter one, verse nine. John is writing to the seven churches, and he says, I, John, your brother and fellow participant in the trials and the kingdom and perseverance that are In Jesus, I was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus. So he doesn't actually say explicitly, I'm in prison here or that I've been exiled here, does he? But that's what kind of the majority view of how he got there. So how do you get that interpretation that he's there because of the word of God and the testimony. So this is important. He's introducing these words here. When a follower of Jesus bears witness to the word of God and this testimony, this message, like, I'm bearing witness to the story of Jesus, he's the risen king of the world, that becomes a key set of phrases that will be repeated over and over again throughout the book. It's kind of like a design pattern. You have to wait for the book to develop what it means, and then you come back and reread the book and you're like, I get it, I get it. So when people are announcing the word of God or sharing it or giving a testimony about Jesus, what that means is they are resisting Babylon. They're resisting the narratives that say that the kingdoms of this world actually run the show and that they have the final say and they're really in charge. So to give a testimony about Jesus is to resist the kingdoms of this world by telling the story of God's kingdom coming on earth as in heaven. And usually it results in followers of Jesus getting alienated, isolated, hurt, or killed. It's gnarly, this little phrase he uses to speak the word of God and the testimony about Jesus is. I mean, we would even use the word like dissent, like a form of political or social dissent.",

    "end": "00:17:47"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah, got it. That's right. And so we live in a different cultural context. John doesn't live in Babylon. He never actually names the empire that he's talking about Rome, not once in the book. All he uses is the names of different ancient biblical empires from the Hebrew scriptures. So that tells us something too, that even he's in a new moment that God's people haven't been in before in the first century. But he finds it important to use these biblical icons of Babylon and Egypt and Sodom because they help give clarity to the ambiguity. So let's watch how he does it, and I think it'll give us guidance for how to find some clarity too, perhaps. So what follows is that he sees the vision, the cosmic apocalypse, where he sees the exalted heavenly throne room of God's kingdom. And in chapters four and five, he sees the slain lamb. We kind of talked about this earlier in conversations. And Jesus, who is the slain lamb? The crucified king, he takes the scroll that represents God's purposes for history, and he starts opening the scroll. And the fifth break of the seals that he opens is in chapter six here, where he opens the fifth seal and he sees up into the heavenly throne room, which is also a temple, and he sees the actual altar. So remember, the heavenly temple is the reality to which the earthly tabernacle and the temple in Jerusalem were symbolic pointers to. So before you go up the steps, or a priest would go up the steps into the temple, he would pass by the altar where all the animals are sacrificed. So he's seeing into the heavenly temple, and he sees in front of it the altar. But what he sees around the altar is not the blood of animals. He sees. This is chapter six, verse nine. I saw under the altar the souls. It's the Greek word. The living beings.",

And really the scene that he wants to paint is that of an altar. But instead of having dead animals on it who are sacrificed, it's dead people. And keep reading. They had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony that they held. And there it is. That's the reason he's on the island of Patmos. It's the same reason why these followers of Jesus are dead. Yeah, so he's talking about martyrs. People have been killed in the first decades of the Jesus movement. They're calling out saying, how long, sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood. So we're back to Cain and Abel here.",

Now, notice they're calling out how long? That itself is a quote from, I think, Psalm 69, the opening, but it's a very common opening. How long, O Lord? So this is a motif in the prophets. In the Old Testament. Prophets. In Psalms, we trust that God's the judge of all the earth. He'll bring justice, visit justice on the oppressors for the bloodshed of the innocent. But he takes a sweet time sometimes. How long, oh Lord? Yeah, that's what they're crying out. So this begins a motif. If you can just track it through, get a concordance about these words, testimony or witness or word of God. And you get all these scenes where people are announcing the testimony, which means to say that Jesus is the risen Lord of this world and that all kings and kingdoms are ultimately answerable to him. And when you say that message to leaders and powers that don't want to hear it, you get the treatment. You get broken kneecaps, you end up slain on the altar. So this happens in Revelation, chapter 11. The two witnesses are testifying against the beast, and a beast comes up and kills them. In Revelation 12, oh, remember we read this about the dragon and the woman and the seed of the woman. There, the dragon comes to wage war against the seed of the woman, which is interpreted by John as those who keep God's commands and hold fast to their testimony about Jesus. So that's the drama.

They do Moses and Elijah stuff so they can shut up the heavens so it won't rain. They can turn water into blood and send plagues, right? Yep. Moses and Elijah.

Whether it's Sodom near the Dead Sea, whether it's Egypt or whether it's Jerusalem, it's the same city, even though it's different cities. This is so important for seeing how the Revelation works as a set of lenses. When you see this pattern of events, you know that you're dealing with a Babylonian type of moment here.

It begins in chapter 12, and it begins with that vision about the woman and the dragon. And the dragon's trying to eat the seed of the woman and so on. So what happens in Revelation 13 is that dragon who's really ticked off, he wants to destroy the woman and her seed. Now he summons up out of the dark chaos waters of Genesis 1, verse 2, he summons up a beast out of the sea, and it's powerful and it tramples people. It's like a military machine. But then he summons up a beast out of the earth. And this is all a parody on Genesis 1 where God summons. He says, let the earth bring forth creatures.

But then also, people are pretty convinced he's also creating a parody here of the goddess Roma, which is the empire of Rome personified as a female goddess, and that he's mixing all of that together into one potent set of images here. So notice the blood of the witnesses comes back up here again. Remember the blood was crying out from the altar back in chapter six. Now she's drinking it. So we're talking here about, you know, it's just. It's classic images of followers of Jesus thrown to the lions in the gladiator arenas and executed in city squares and this kind of thing. And, you know, so for Rome, this was a point of pride to be able to display its domination of the nations and people groups around to build roads, to bring the Pax Romana the peace. Peace. Roman peace. But it was always accompanied. It was a peace accomplished through domination, crucifixion of thousands of people. And Bujan wants us to see, like, you know, the center of Rome is not this glorious, honorable place. It's a prostitute riding a beast and a dragon drunk with the blood of innocent people. That's what he wants us to see spiritually, again, with those glasses on, the apocalyptic glasses. So intense. But when you see this image, there's no ambivalence. It's just like, oh, that's evil. You know what I mean? You can't read this description and be like, well, I don't know, maybe she was good to some people. It's like she wants you to. He wants you to see the dark.",

It's the longest list of economic trade goods of the Roman Empire anywhere in ancient Greek or Roman literature. It's A list of 30 types of trade that Rome engaged in. So this is Revelation 18, starting in verse 9, when the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury, see the smoke of her burning. Just like Abram saw the smoke of Sodom rising up. So now here's the new Sodom. Smoke of its destruction is rising, but the kings of the earth are crying. They're weeping and mourning, terrified at her torment, standing far off, crying, oh, woe to you, great city, mighty city of Babylon. In one hour your doom has come. And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn because, well, no one buys their cargo anymore. Cargoes of. And here it is. Gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple silk, scarlet cloth, every sort of citron wood, articles made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron, marble, cargoes of cinnamon, spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages. And then these last two words he's placed very strategically at the end. The 29th number item of the list is bodies. And then he clarifies that is human lives. So really, again, this was Richard Baucom who brought this to my attention in an important way. He really wants to paint the portrait of the economic prosperity of the Roman world. Yeah, of the Roman world. It was a time that brought huge. Yeah. Economic abundance for some. For some. And the fact that he saves for the last. These two terms to refer to the slave trade is really significant. So he uses these word bodies, and then he clarifies that is human lives. That's the last item of cargo. I'll just read. This is Richard Baucom. I'll just read how he puts it. He says John gives considerable emphasis to the reference to slaves. By placing them at the end of the list.

This is more than just John's comment on the slave trade. It's a comment on the whole list of cargo. It suggests the inhuman brutality, the contempt for human life on which the whole of Rome's prosperity and luxury rests. And you just have to stop and you just have to say, like John, this is a pointed economic critique of a whole system. You know, we've grown up in a culture that says politics and religion and economics, they're like separate spheres. You know, you can go study and major in separate. You know, I major in economics, I major in religion. And that's fine to like, if you want to study and learn about these fields. But it lulls us into thinking that these are actually like separate spheres of our lives, you know, and that religion doesn't have to do with these other things, you know. And a point like this in Revelation 18, I think just tells the lie on that one. He's exposing that. I think it's part of the seedbed of the anti slavery, the logical outcome of a Christian worldview. And it took Christians centuries to actually own that conclusion. But in a text like this, Revelation 18, you can see the roots of it right there, can't you? And again, Baucom's point is he puts slaves last in the list because it's like the. It's the foundation of the whole thing. The whole economy is built on dehumanizing people as bodies instead of human beings.",

No craftsmen, no crafts will be found. The sound of the mill will not be heard in you. No light of the lamp will shine. The voice of the bridegroom and bride will no longer be heard. Your merchants were great men of the earth and all nations were deceived by your sorcery. Then this is the final line. Because in Babylon was found all the blood of the prophets and saints and of all who have been murdered on the earth. Remember, we've been tracing this theme of when followers of Jesus bear witness to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. That was kind of the focus of the book. Right. That's John's audience. But then in this climactic way, he makes Babylon responsible not just for the blood of persecuted followers of Jesus, but the last line is, and of all who have been murdered on the earth. So he's thinking all the way back to Abel. When you see the blood of the innocent, not just because they are followers of Jesus, anybody, any innocent blood that you see that's connected to these systems of oppression and injustice, you're looking at Babylon. It's Babylon manifesting itself. That's what he's saying right here. And the fact he saves us for the last line is so significant. I think he's trying to teach us how to spot Babylon, it seems to me. And when you put all this together in light of the design patterns and how he calls Babylon, also Sodom, Egypt, Jerusalem. He's trying to teach us how to see spiritually, when Babylon raises its head and the murder of the innocent is like, key criterion on his list.",

And so it's being loyal to the dream. Right. That America could represent. It's a kind of loyalty. There's something there of subversive loyalty where it's loyalty to the best ideals of what my society wants, says it wants to pursue. And how can I be loyal to those? Even the loyalty to those ideals might often mean subversion of the current institutions or leadership structures in the form that they are right now. And I think that in many ways that's a good way to capture what's going on right now. And so as a follower of Jesus, the Book of Revelation, I think, gives us a very powerful set of lenses to think about what that subversive loyalty looks like, which means naming idolatry, naming Cultural values and systems that benefit some at the expense of others and naming that as idolatry, you know, so you're right.

He hears about a group of 144,000, which is the 12 tribes of Israel, times 12. That's what he hears. He hears the number of these people who are sealed with God's seal. But then he looks and he tries to see this group. What he sees is not 144,000. What he sees is Revelation 7, 9. A great multitude which nobody could count. People from every nation, every tribe, every people, every language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes with palm branches in their hands. This is all about how Passover and also the feast of Tabernacles got celebrated in Jerusalem with all these palm branches. And they're crying out with a loud voice saying, rescue belongs to our God, to the one sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb. And then when John asks his little tour guide who these are, he says, these are the ones who have come out of the great test, the great trial. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. And it's this image of when God's people are faithful, when they find themselves in Babylon, there will be tension. It will create conflict and tension, just like Jesus created conflict inside of everybody he was around. And that's not a bad thing, because it can be apocalyptic. It can expose, you know, what. What needs to be exposed. But we're invited. This image of putting on the white robe that's washed in the blood of the lamb. That's such a great contradictory metaphor. Yeah, but it's like what Jesus was to Jerusalem of his day, and, you know, he charged into Jerusalem and he told them what he thought, you know, and he. He got killed for it. But that may or may not be required in any given context, but bearing witness to the crucified Jesus as the way to confront the idolatrous powers of our world, this is like. This is the bread and butter of the biblical story. And I just want to make sure that my eyes aren't closed to the apocalypse happening around me.
