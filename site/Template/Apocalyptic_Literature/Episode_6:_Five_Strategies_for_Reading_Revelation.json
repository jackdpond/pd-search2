From this point on, what I want to get is more practical, like how to actually read this literature and understand it. At least take a step forward in your understanding of it. So one part of it is to understand we're not interpreting this literature in a vacuum. So it's important to know that you're likely already somewhere on a grid of how people read the book. So what I want to quick is use the work of a scholar, Michael Gorman, who's created a really helpful map to understand all the different approaches and why they are the way they are.",

So, first of all, Jewish apocalyptic literature is widespread, both in the Hebrew Bible, in the New Testament, and in literature that was never considered part of the biblical collection. So that's the first thing to notice is when we say how to read a apocalyptic literature in the Bible were narrowing to really a small section of a much wider body of literature from ancient Judaism. That's just helpful to realize. So what we're doing now would actually hold true for reading 1 Enoch or 2nd Baruch or 4th Esther.",

With Daniel, it's a bit of a misnomer because half of the book is these dreams and visions. But the first half of the book are narratives about Daniel and his friends, and they go to. Those two halves go together in a crucially important way. But the whole book isn't apocalyptic like the Revelation is. It's also true that there are sections of other books that are apocalypses, like Zechariah. First half of the book is about his dreams and visions in the heavenly temple. Sections of the book of Ezekiel at the beginning, middle, and end. The prophet Isaiah has an apocalypse in one chapter, chapter six. The prophet Amos has a series of apocalypses, chapter seven through nine. And then we talked about Abraham has dreams and visions. So does Jacob. So there you go. In a way, what we're focusing in on is when you have a whole book or a section of a book that is full of this kind of dream imagery, that's what we're focusing in on. So Michael Gorman is a New Testament scholar who's written the most clever title of a book on Revelation. And seriously, it's the first thing I recommend in hand to people.

But the whole point is it's a code about a very particular, specific series of events that once they have happened, you can decipher the code and the book will have served its function.

However, there have always been, and there is a resurgence of views that have more of a reader's present focus and viewing the text not as a code of secret fulfillments, but of viewing it as a lens through which the reader is to look at their present in a new way. So he calls these. One is called the poetic or theopoetic, and I'll just let him define it. He says the Revelation uses mythical and poetic symbolism and language to. To express ultimate truths about God, evil and history. This is sometimes called the idealist or spiritual approach. Essentially, it's all of the images symbolize ideals, good and evil, God's kingdom. And it's not trying to locate it at any particular time or moment in history. It's about realities that are always happening in any time and any place. Fourth in this family over here would be. He calls it the theopolitical. It's essentially the book originated out of a time of suffering and persecution, which is partially true. It's a document that is a form of political protest and dissent from the powers that be, namely the Roman Empire in the first century. And so its main purpose is actually to give readers a vision of the kingdom of God as the antithesis of the kingdoms of this world. And it's meant to fuel endurance and faithfulness despite opposition. Another approach in here he calls pastoral, prophetic. In that, and this is the most encompassing in that it comes from the past, but it's meant to speak to every generation of readers through our present and on into the future by means of its imagery, through which we see the world in a new way through these images and symbols, and that it's essentially a pastoral letter calling the church to faithfulness, giving comfort and giving warning and challenge.

And so it is working as a poetic work. I think that's how it transcends the first century. It speaks to us. It is theopolitical. It's very much about economics and politics and religion and power. And it's also pastoral. It's a word spoken to communities of Jesus followers. So it's essentially on that side of the column or that side of the table that we're going to fill out.",

But the book, like all apocalypses, you get up on the mountain and you can see the whole landscape of human history. Yahweh looks down from his throne, right.

That would have been a preterist around it. So, yeah, that's right. Predictive view would be to say this is going to be a new city, a new Babylon that is yet to be built from which a world empire will be ruled. It's a code we're waiting for a city with seven hills. Viewing it as a lens would be to say the imagery of the dragon didn't come from those seven hills. That came from the poetic images of chaos and evil in the Hebrew Bible. And those images are political images of how. Of a spiritual rebellion at work in and through human empires and power structures, theopolitical. And that image is anchored in the Roman powers for the original audience, but by calling it a dragon now frees it from its Roman context, from being limited to that, to now speak of any human power institution that acts like the beast for any generation, including mine. And so now that image that is anchored in the past becomes an image for me to talk about human power structures in my present and in my grandchildren's future. It's the dragon with seven heads.

All of the sevens are iterations of the flood design pattern in the Hebrew Bible, because the flood design pattern then becomes the 10 plagues, which is a new flood of divine justice, which becomes the conquest of Joshua on the Canaanites, this new flood of divine justice. And this is all through hyperlinks and word patterns and so on. But you get this portrait of when there are moments of God bringing the hammer on the city of man because of the shedding the blood of the innocent. All of that's rooted in Genesis 1:11. And so these cycles of seven, the opening of the scroll, the seven seals of the scroll, the seven trumpets, the seven bowls of God's anger, each one of those is working out literally. The language of all these sevens is you take the flood narrative, the ten plagues, the conquest narrative, and then a bunch of stuff from the prophets about the fall of Babylon, and you put them in a blender. That's what you get. So chapter 12 through 15 represents a pause in between the second and third cycle of seven. It gives you almost a meta commentary on the whole biblical story. It retells the whole biblical story in a set of seven signs. There's seven signs that he sees, and this is the first one, Revelation 12. A great sign appeared in the heavens. A woman clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of 12 stars. She was with child. She's pregnant. She cried out in labor, and in labor pains gave birth. Another sign in the skies. A great red drakon dragon. Seven heads, ten horns. On the heads are seven crowns. His tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven, throwing them to the land. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth, he could eat the child. Whoa. She gave birth to a son, a male child who was to rule all of the nations with a rod of iron. But that child was snatched up to God in his throne. The woman fled into the wilderness, where a place was prepared for her where she could find nourishment for 1000, 260 days.",

First thing we talked about just a minute ago, read the work as a whole and look at how themes and ideas develop and especially look for the most repeated anchor images. So in the Revelation, this is going to be the heavenly throne room, the lamb, Jesus is only referred to in two places in the book as something other than the lamb. He's the Son of man in the first chapter, and he's the word of God riding on a white horse in the end. And in the middle, he's always the lamb, the dragon and the beast. Essentially, these are the one on the heavenly throne. The lamb, the dragon and the beast are like the key characters in the story. So those are clearly anchor images. And so as I want to go through the book as I'm reading it in sequence, then is to begin to identify what the symbols are and then begin to decode them. Not decode the book to look for predictive fulfillment, but to decode the symbols to understand what they mean. And there's two places that you need to look. The first is always the Hebrew Bible. The second layer is 1st century Greco Roman context, which is a little bit harder because you can't just turn there like you can with the Hebrew Bible.

And I think this should send our imaginations to the exaltation of the humans in Genesis 1. And then in God's promise to Abraham that your seed will be like the stars. Psalm 8.

This is yet another whole section of the Bible that's primarily appealing to our imagination. Imagery and symbols, and imagery and symbols communicate more than just an idea. They shape your view of reality. When you shape somebody's Imagination. You're shaping their sense of what is real. And here we are to two more books of the Bible and the sections of a bunch of others where when people ascend into the heavenly realm, they get a God's eye view of past, present and future. But what they see are symbols. To me, that's just. That's so important to protect and honor that it's another part of the Bible shaping us more than it is giving us information.",

Except that those who follow the lamb, which is the description of Jesus followers in the book of Revelation, those who listen to the lamb's voice and follow him wherever he goes. It's an image that undercuts all sense of triumphalism and superiority. Whatever God's kingdom looks like, it doesn't exalt people. It exalts the one human who did for us what none of us could do for ourselves and whom we killed, with whom we all partnered with the dragon in participating in contributing to a world system that killed our creator. But his love and creative power is so great that even death can't conquer his love and life that he wants to give us as a gift. That's what these images mean. So powerful. And so this is Michael Gorman's point then. The pastoral function of this book is to summon every generation of its readers to follow the lamb in its footsteps and to resist the beast within and without, and to suffer along with the lamb if need be and bearing witness to what he's done.
