How God is the generous host of all creation and there's enough for everyone. So why don't we live that way? The first few chapters of Genesis show humanity's propensity to mistrust the generous host. We want to protect ourselves and we think we have the best strategy for. For how to do that. Unfortunately, our self protection leads us to shame, broken relationships and violence. So what's God gonna do? Well, it turns out his plan is to ramp up his generosity.",

That's what you're made for. And that's why you're so bothered living in a world that's not like that. So here's Genesis 3 to 11, here's how we got here. And then Genesis 12, Abraham and forward. Here's what God has been up to in history to recreate an even greater Eden for the human family.

God gave the gift of the land to our ancestors and there was enough. They had to trust. And there were many tests, but they had to trust. And God provided and blessed them in the land of Canaan. Then we were exiled from the land of Canaan, suffering in Egypt. But now we have the chance to go back to Eden. And then of course, when they finally get there, they do what the first humans did to Eden, which is screw it all up. So I think those two go together. We're made for Eden, like creation. And that's where the story is. Ultimately going. But every human that reads the Bible is waking up and not Eden. How'd we get here? And what is God doing in history to get us back to a creation permeated with God's life?",

And you read the stories. Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, they don't do it. They just create another Babylon. They create a metaphorical Babylon in Israel, and then they end up in literal Babylon in another exile. And so the whole story is again of squandered generosity. And so both for all humanity and now for the family that God chose to spread blessing to the world. What's going to happen now? And that leads us right to the doorstep of the story of Jesus announcing the kingdom of God has arrived.",
