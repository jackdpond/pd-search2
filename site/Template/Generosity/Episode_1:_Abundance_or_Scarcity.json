    "text": "Hey everybody, I'm Tim Mackey and welcome to the BibleProject podcast. Today on the podcast, we are starting a new series that's connected to a brand new Bible project theme video that we're working on. And it's about a topic that is actually really important in the biblical story, but it also is a vital part of our everyday lived experience. The theme is generosity, and it's connected to the experience that most of us know, which is that of scarcity and abundance. Scarcity causes a lot of anxiety in the human psyche. And Jesus knew a lot about anxiety through his own personal life experience. And he talked about it a lot too. He said famous lines like this from Luke chapter 12. Therefore I tell you, don't be anxious about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear for life is more than food and the body is more than clothes. Consider the ravens. They don't sow or reap. They don't have any storerooms or barns. And yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds? Who of you, by worrying, could add a single hour to your life? And since you can't do this very little thing, why do you worry about all the rest? Now, if you're like me, when you hear those words of Jesus, your first reaction might be that this sounds like somebody who's a hippie or carefree. So what's happening here? When we hear the words of Jesus but actually want to resist or come up with objections to what he's saying, this isn't a unique experience to us. This is what happens to lots of people when they hear Jesus teachings about anxiety and the freedom from being a slave to your possessions and your money. What's happening is a clash of worldviews. I simply don't hold the same view of the universe that Jesus does when it comes to thinking about money, possessions, resources, scarcity and abundance. So in this episode, we're going to dig into this teaching of Jesus, and what we're going to discover is Jesus is actually articulating a mindset, a whole view of the world that has been soaked and immersed in page one of Genesis. Jesus has a conception of the universe, the that it's a beautiful creation packed with an overabundance of resources and opportunities and potential, and that it's a generous gift of the Creator to us. Jesus believes that we are all being hosted by this generous Creator. And if we can just tune in to that Creator's love and overwhelming generosity, it will change how you live and experience all of Life. So how did Jesus get this mindset? How did he hold this mindset of generosity with all the pain and suffering that he saw around him? How did Jesus believe all these ideas when he was suffering and being killed on the cross? These are some of the questions that we're going to ask today as we begin to trace the theme of generosity throughout the storyline of the Bible. You guys, thank you for joining us on the Bible Project podcast. Here we go.",

How much more valuable are you than birds? And which of you, by worrying, can add an hour to his lifespan? And if you can't do even a very little thing, why then do you worry about other matters? Ponder the lilies, how they grow. They don't toil or spin clothes like material fabric. But I tell you, not even Solomon, in all his glory, clothed himself like one of these. And if God so clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow's thrown into the furnace, how much more will he clothe? You, you who trust God so little and do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, don't foster your anxiety, for all of these things the nations of the world eagerly seek. And your Father knows that you need these things. But seek his kingdom and all these things will be granted to you. Don't be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, Give to the poor. Make for yourselves the money belts that don't wear out in unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.",

If the biblical story can be framed as God's gift of abundance to humans, the plot conflict is how they distort abundance, which is to desire according to their own wisdom and then to take thank you for listening to this episode of the BibleProject podcast. Next week we're going to keep diving into the theme of generosity in the storyline of the Bible. We're going to look, as always, at the Garden of Eden stories and explore how they demonstrate God's generosity, His generous, overabundant character. It's gonna be awesome. Today's show was produced by Dan Gummel. Theme music was by the band Tense. We are a crowdfunded animation studio in Portland, Oregon and you can find all of our resources@thebibleproject.com everything we make is because of your generous support. So thanks for being part of this with us.",
