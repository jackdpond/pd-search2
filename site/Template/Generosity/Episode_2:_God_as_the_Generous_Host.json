    "text": "Hey, everybody, this is tim@the Bibleproject and you're listening to the Bibleproject podcast. Last week, John and I started a new conversation about the theme of generosity in the storyline of the Bible. This is connected to a new video that we're making at the Bible Project. In the last episode, we explored some of Jesus most famous teachings about freedom from anxiety and learning about the generosity and abundance that God has in store for his people. Jesus walked around with this deep conviction that despite all of the pain and suffering that he saw going on in the world, despite all the pain and suffering that he himself experienced, he still believed that Yahweh, the God of Israel, the creator of heaven and earth, is an extremely generous host who has given an overabundance of resources and opportunities to all of us. Jesus was able to manage that tension and think it through because you can see in his teachings, his heart and his mind were soaked in the Hebrew scriptures and specifically the portrait of the generous God in Genesis chapters one and two. So that's what we're going to look at today. We're going to explore the creation story in Genesis 1 and how it portrays God as an extremely generous host who's packing creation full of abundance and opportunity. We're also going to look at the story of Adam and Eve, how they forfeit and take advantage of God's generosity. And then we're going to go into the next story outside of Eden. We're going to explore the story of Cain and Abel, which one way to think about it is a story about one person who gets angry about God's seeming generosity to another. How do you respond when you feel like God's being more generous to somebody else, but not to you? And that raises an even more fascinating question that keeps getting focused on throughout the storyline of the Bible. The concept of God choosing a whole line of people and being extremely generous to them. The family of Abraham. John and I explore the topic of election and. And why it is that God seems to be generous to some more than he is to others. Or maybe we're just thinking about this all upside down. We're gonna explore these questions and more today on the podcast. So thanks for joining us. And here we go. So we're talking about the theme of generosity in the storyline of the Bible.",

This series is kind of short. We just have a couple more episodes where we're going to be discussing generosity and after that, as we normally do, we want to host a Q and R episode. So if these conversations about generosity in the Bible have piqued your curiosity, or if you have some questions, we would love to hear them. Please send them to us. You can record an audio file of yourself and send it to us@info jointhebibleproject.com if you can try to keep your question about 20 or 30 seconds. We would love also to hear your name and where you're from. Today's show was produced by Dan Gummel. Theme music is by the band Tents. The bibleproject is a crowdfunded animation studio in Portland, Oregon. We make all of these videos and resources and podcasts. It's all available for free because of people like you and your generous support. So thank you guys so much for being a part of this with us.",
