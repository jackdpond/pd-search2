God is the generous host of all creation. He created life in abundance and he created humanity to share and extend that abundance. But what we find instead is that humans don't trust the host. We don't believe there's enough, and we believe that we know the best way to create security in life for ourselves. But our way doesn't create life. It creates mistrust, broken relationships, pain and death. We don't create abundance. We create Babylon.",

So he gets to the part where he's critiquing Israel's misunderstanding of the laws of the Torah. This is Matthew 5. There's six sayings of Jesus where he says, listen, you've heard what it said.

We've talked about this, I think. Yeah. This chapter is related to Paul's. One of his big projects, which was to raise money to give to the poor in Jerusalem. Correct. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So there was A famine that hit. Pubments happen, famines happen. A lot of people hitting hard times. And so Paul gets all of these church plants that's full of all these non Jewish people to raise money and give it as a gift to their spiritual ancestors, so to speak, Messianic Jews in Jerusalem. Here's the backstory. In First Corinthians, he ends the letter saying, hey, you guys, remember when I was there, we talked about how every week you're going to be setting aside money when you gather for worship and the meal, you're going to set aside money to save up. Because I'm going to come or I'm going to send somebody to come and collect it pretty soon and then take it to Jerusalem.",

And so he's in a difficult situation because what he needs to tell them, as their church planting founder is, dude, be generous, be generous and save up the money. And you said you were going to do it anyway, so why haven't you been doing it? But Paul's normal tactic is not to, like leverage his authority and just bring the hammer. He always uses a loving type of persuasion because that's what God did with him. And so that's how. So watch how he navigates this. It's fascinating. Second Corinthians, chapter eight. So, brothers, brothers and sisters, I want to tell you about the grace of God that has been given to the churches of Macedonia. So let's just pause the word grace. In Greek, it's the word charis.
