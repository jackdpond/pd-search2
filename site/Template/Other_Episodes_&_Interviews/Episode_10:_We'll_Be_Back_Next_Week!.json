    "text": "Hey, this is John from Bibleproject. And today would have been our 287th episode of the Bibleproject podcast. 287 episodes where we would have not missed a week. We even somehow managed to get this far in the global pandemic and release a new episode every week. But unfortunately, we are mere humans and we have to let you know that our next podcast episode won't be available until next Monday. It's an off week, a bye week. So next Monday we'll continue in our conversations in the Genesis scroll, looking at the third movement, the stories of Jacob. But this week, feel free to jump into our back catalog and listen to an episode you haven't heard in a while. And if you haven't listened to the podcast in our new app, I highly recommend it. We have an augmented feature within the app that gives you real time information as you're listening to the podcast. Links to videos, links to notes, links to scripture. As we're dialoguing, get the app ON Android and iOS in your app store and then click on the button Podcast. The next theme that we're going to be looking at is a new theme. And to prepare yourself for the theme, I would suggest listening to any of our episodes on generosity. We have a series on generosity. We also have a really cool story called God and Money. It's the story of two Harvard business students who have a radical encounter with their paradigm of God and money. Whatever you do this week, I hope it is splendid and we'll see you next Monday.",
