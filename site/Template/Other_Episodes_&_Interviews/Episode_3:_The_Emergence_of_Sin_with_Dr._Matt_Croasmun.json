Sin has a body. In Paul's thought. He has this phrase, the body of sin, talking of what sounds like a person. So these two ideas combine in his mind.

And it was a good church that instilled a sort of love of scripture, if also, you know, some sort of biblicist leaning, sort of, you know, some ideas about what the Bible was. You know, I mean, I remember like sort of getting to college with this belief that the Bible was this sort of magic book where if anyone read it with a fair, with an open mind, they would come to the rational conclusion that Jesus Christ had died on the cross to save them from their sins. And I would invite my secular friends to like read the Bible and they seemed pretty fair minded and they didn't come to that conclusion. And I remember feeling a bit betrayed. I don't know if anyone ever told me that, you know, no one, I think, ever probably said it exactly that way, but somewhere I had this belief about the Bible. So definitely getting into biblical studies. And I think just growing up required sort of reconfiguring a good deal of those sort of. It's not really the Bible. It's like beliefs about the Bible that were sort of hanging on to it and sort of figuring out how to set some of those aside that needed to be set aside while still finding Scripture to be a place that God inhabited and a place where I still might be able to meet with God and bring my questions and try to sort of puzzle out the sort of deeper questions of life in that space.",

I remember seeing a TED talk on sort of synchronicity and how complex systems just tend to sort of sync up. And there was this image that actually did make it into the book of the London Millennial Bridge or Millennium Bridge, the day that it was open. And the way that sort of the crowd just walking across the bridge and the bridge's physical structure and the movement of these people sort of became this sort of feedback loop where, I don't know, just sort of randomly, the bridge started the. You know, more people were walking to the left than to the right. And the bridge starts to sway just a little bit. And the more that the bridge starts to sway, the more people have to walk in step with the movement of the bridge. And then the thing just keeps feeding back on itself. And eventually you see this bridge swinging violently back and forth and people having a hard time standing up. And anyway, there was that idea. I forget there were several other sort of TED talks and this idea. I didn't know what emergence was, but I kept thinking I sort of had a list of TED talks where I. The same idea just keeps coming up over and over and over again. And then what happened was I was reading Jerome Murphy o' Connor in his Theological anthropology, his Pauline Theological Anthropology called Becoming Human Together, I think, and he described sin this way. And I think I described this in the book as sort of like. He was like, maddeningly, tantalizingly close, I thought, to the case. And he describes this, you know, this system which. There is no dictator who can be blamed for this. He says it's a little bit like these racist. These patriarchal. These. We can get into some of what these concrete systems might look like, but are all these sort of unjust systems that sort of catch us up, make us start to walk in step, as it were. And he said, he. He used language that sounds exactly like the Millennium Bridge. He said, it's like a crowd getting swept up in a panic. And I thought, this is it. Then he goes on and says, it is easy to see how this sense of being swayed by a force beyond human control could be transmuted in the mind of simple people into a belief in a supernatural, evil power. And I just thought, what? You know, all of a sudden we have to call people, you know, simple minded. For where is that coming from? The moment I. I thought you mean simple people. Simple minded people like Paul. And then I guess the final piece was to think, I think Jerome Murphy OConnors argument here is that we shouldn't confuse a complex system with a human person. But then the more I started to look into biological anthropology, the more I started to think, well, what else is a human person on the modern scientific account, other than a complex person or a complex system, rather.",

So you, in one of the opening chapters, you address what has been presented as a puzzle to modern interpreters of Paul, that he'll use the verb to sin or the noun sin, describing stupid things that people do, terrible things people do. We've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. But then Paul will also use the noun sin, especially in Romans, as you'll use the noun as an active agent of verbs. Sin enslaves, it rules, it deceives, it takes captive. And this has been a puzzle in modern interpretation of Paul So people explain it in different ways, and it ties into what you're talking about. Is this a mythological entity? Is this an invisible spiritual being with wings flapping around somewhere?",

  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah. So basically, three different approaches I think that we can see. One. The first would be sort of Bultmann's approach. Great sort of modernist biblical critic and the great Demythologizer. And his basic take was Paul may describe sin as a cosmic tyrant, as some sort of supernatural agent, but any of us, he thinks, who live in a world with modern technology can no longer entertain these sorts of fantasies. We need to find some other way of reading Paul's text to make it meaningful for us. Namely, we need to make it about our existential struggles to be moral, to be authentic, to be true to ourselves and sort of noble and just. And the second response, the second sort of approach to that actually comes from one of his doctoral students, Ernst Kazeman, who very much in reaction to this, insists no, one of the first, to give us a sort of thoroughly apocalyptic Paul, where this sort of. This vibrant spiritual world isn't an incidental feature of Paul's thought that we can just scrape away to make it more amenable to our purposes. But Cazemon says, no, no, no. That's actually the sort of fundamental issue for Paul. What it is to be human is to be someone set under lordship, either of sin and evil or of grace and of God and of love. And, I mean, this is the sort of Bob Dylan, you know, it may be the devil, it may be the Lord, but you're gonna have to serve somebody. Kazeman to this day has followers. Beverly Gaventa, J. Louis Martin, folks like this, whose work I find really compelling in many ways. The third approach comes from the sort of the liberationist camp, largely in Latin America. And these folks suggest that whatever you might say about sin as sort of individual existential failures or as sort of a matter of cosmic tyranny, maybe the most salient way that we see sin in the modern world is actually as embedded in social institutions. And so here there's some Marxist intuitions working. So, you know, it's going to be the capitalist system, it's going to be unjust governments, it's going to be corporations that operate certain ways, racist structures, sexist structures. And their thought is that these sorts of structures aren't just full of sinful people. The sin that we See, operating there isn't just an aggregate, just an adding up of the sins of the individuals that are involved. There's actually a remainder left over that you can't really assign other than to the structure and the. In the institutions themselves. And so Oscar Romero and others really, like, lean into that interpretation. And it struck me, I guess, at first glance, sort of, why do we have to choose?",

So basically, when you think about emergence, you're thinking about, first of all, you're thinking about the world as being stratified into various sorts of layers of complexity. And so in the physical sciences, we can think about that as a sort of the smallest, the micro. The most basic fundamental level is the sort of what particle physics and, you know, various sorts of physics describe. Then we would move up into the chemical and the thought being, you know, a bunch of atoms doing their things or a bunch of subatomic particles doing their things becomes, at some point, chemistry. A bunch of chemicals doing their thing eventually becomes biology. A certain sort of set of biological things doing their things becomes psychology. A bunch of individual psychologies doing their things become sociology or become social entities. And you could keep on going. And actually, there are multiple different ways of multiple different philosophies of science all agree on this basic feature of the world. And basically the big question of philosophy of science, or one of the big questions is how do you relate these layers? And the sort of classic reductionist view would say, well, all that's real is what's really happening at the smallest, most fundamental level. So, you know, we can start all the way up in the social. What's happening in a social system? Well, there's nothing real in a social system. That's just a convenient metaphor to use for talking about a bunch of individual psychologies. But when we think about individual psychologies, there's nothing real going on there either. What's really happening is a bunch of neurons firing inside a bunch of people's brains.",

  {
    "text": "Yeah, like racism. Right. So a sort of reductionist view would say there's no real thing called race. Or maybe there's not even a real thing called racism. That's just a convenient way for talking about. For example, in some studies we have a sort of amygdala excitation, you know, sort of the fight, fight or flight response part of the brain sort of lighting up in certain social situations when you see an unfamiliar face to trigger this response. They say, oh, you can just see it's, it's. This is actually just brain function and the brain function is just chemistry and the chemistry is just physics. And, and the only thing that's real are these, are these very, very lowest levels. Emergence suggests instead that these higher levels actually are irreducible to explaining the world as it actually is. That these aren't just convenient ways of talking about large sets of smaller entities, but that chemicals are real and biological animals are, are real and appropriate to talk about as, as units, shorthand for talking about piles of particles. But it is true still to say an emergentist would want to make sure it is. They say it's important to still say that a chemical is composed of atoms and subatomic particles that do obey the laws of physics. And it is appropriate to say that, for example, racism is going to have sort of neurobiological substructure. It shouldn't be surprising that you can see in an FMRI machine, you can almost see racism happen, as it were. That's a simplification, right? But that the world is sort of stitched together this way. So those relationships, the sort of dependency of higher level, higher order social entities, say on psychology or psychologies dependent on biologies, those relationships are called relationships of supervenience. But then what's interesting then is then you have this other half, which is this downward causation piece where it's not just that my psychology emerges from my biology, but then on the emergence account, my psychology actually sort of constrains biology in ways that change sort of how my biology works. Which I take it is exactly what you can see in that FMRI machine where the social institution of American racism is actually changing the brain chemistry of American patients.",

The individual bees aren't genetically distinct. They're all genetic copies of the queen. So, you know, entomologist E.O. wilson suggests that it's better to think about individual bees the way you'd think about individual cells in your body. You have a bunch of different cells, but they all contain the same DNA and they all sort of express. Help you be you and do what you do. And he's. Which really starts to sound like man. Maybe the hive, maybe the hive is the organism. And each bee is sort of like a cell. And the ways that they differentiate from one another are sort of the ways that like a skin cell is different from a blood cell, not the way that like, one human being is different from another. But the whole point here is that. Well, it's sort of an open question, and neither answer seems obviously wrong, but certainly the larger option seems totally plausible. Maybe the superorganism is the right level to be like the individual. That's the real thing.

And I started to think, well, what on earth is the body of sin? And thought, well, I mean, one, like, obvious answer would be it's analogous to the body of Christ. Why doesn't anybody read it like that? It turns out Anders Nygren did back in the day, but very few people have read it that way. But I started to think, well, if sin is a person, then might sin not have a body? And if sin had a body, what sort of body would it be? Well, it might really be something analogous in certain ways to the body of Christ, that is that we might sort of make up collectively the body of sin. And as our desires are being fundamentally shaped, or we might say from a moral point of view, misshapen by certain sorts of social perversions, Augustine thinks that what you love is actually what you desire. This is actually central to, like, your moral formation. So once we see a sort of market economy, you know, the onslaught of advertising starting to fundamentally shape the way what it is that we desire, we can start to see, oh, here it is. I'm starting to become a sort of part of some larger entity which I take it Paul is describing as the body of sin.",

You were the first person who drawn my attention to Nygren's work about the body of sin as like this antichrist, as like an anti body of Christ. And maybe it means grappling anew with the imagery of body of Christ, which is on the surface more familiar to many readers of Paul's letters because he uses it all over the place. But we wouldn't say, well, therefore Christ the new human isn't real because he is constituted by his body. No one takes that away from Paul's phrase, the body of Christ. Maybe some people do. Maybe some people do. I don't know. But I'm just trying to play out the analogy. The body of sin, the body of Christ. It begs a question, of course, then who. Who or what is that person? Who's the head of the body of sin? That's the equivalent to the head of the body of Christ in Paul's thought. And what should that be in our thought too? Do you have any thoughts about that?",

That is, it's not like no church and then there's no Christ anymore. But we might think about the body of sin that way. And so trying to keep this too far, not from straying too far into the theological nerd Dom route, but there are. Well, I'll try this out. So there are, in certain ways of thinking about the doctrine of God, you can talk about God having two different natures, consequent and antecedent. What those mean are the antecedent nature of God is God's sort of prior existent prior existence as sort of the ground of all being. But then God also has this consequent sort of existence in along these lines of theological reflection, which is God in relation to God's creation as it unfolds. And I think we would say, if that's true about God and therefore true about Christ, we would then say that sin would be like Christ in that it has this consequent nature, it's part of the unfolding of creation, but it would not share in God's antecedent nature, this sort of prior existence that is sin's just a creature like us, and I take it, no sinners, then there is no sin, at least on this reading, but no church.

What Lewis is pointing at, and what Karl Barth also would be sort of in line with this thinking is that sin may be less real even than a creature. I'll leave that as an open question. But at any rate, what it isn't is it's not as real as God. What it certainly isn't is we don't have a dualistic world here where there's the angel on one shoulder and there's the devil on the other, or there's God. The power of good and sin or the devil as the power of evil. And they're sort of. They're equal. Equal and opposite forces. There is a priority to the good. I think that's a helpful corrective for us because if we're. It depends on what sorts of lines we're trying to draw. If we're drawing a line between natural on the one hand and supernatural on the other, then we'd be inclined to put ourselves on the natural side and maybe sin, any sort of cosmic power, demons, et cetera, and God and angels on the supernatural side. But Paul didn't know anything about a natural or supernatural division that was invented during the Enlightenment. If instead we're drawing a Pauline distinction between created things on the one hand and the Creator on the other, then I think we're working with categories that are more familiar to Paul. And in that case, sin definitely goes on our side of the line, maybe even a little further, further away from the real maybe than we are, if Barth or Lewis is right.

This is where Cazeman is right. Paul's imagination is. No, you're always already part of a sort of social existence.

Yeah, thank you so much. This has been very fun to talk with you, if you were to, you know, you're in a local church or you're invited to a campus group, Christian campus group, and you're trying to share what you think matters about these ideas. In the evening, talk to some college students or to a local church. What are some ways that you would encourage just a local community of Jesus followers to take these ideas seriously?",

    "text": "I think for me, what's most important is to help people see themselves as fundamentally socially constrained. See, I think the mythology that we're bought into is a myth of individuality, a myth of individualism. And those are the things I think that need to be demythologized. And so I want to help people see, rightly, the ways that we are not our own masters. We are constrained by our social institutions, by the communities we choose to invest in, by the patterns of thought we choose to fall into, or rather don't all that intentionally choose. And so therefore think really seriously about our participation in certain sorts of systems and to take seriously our culpability when we participate in racist, sexist, classist systems of various sorts. But then the other thing that I want to say, and of course you pose this as a hypothetical. I'm a Vineyard pastor. This is my world. The other thing that's really important to me is to say to people, look, all three of these ways of thinking about sin are important and valuable because they point to different parts of the Christian life. It's important to think about sin at the individual level. My own sort of. My individual misdeeds, the ways that I harm other people in the world, and to think about sort of personal discipleship and sometimes therapy. Right. Is a really important part of that. Like working on my psychology. That's actually really important and part of my discipleship. But it's also important to recognize the sort of large social structures and to strive for justice, you know, in response to the sort of malformations of social structures. And that's also an important part of discipleship, and it's an important part of participating in the coming of God's kingdom. But it's also also important at the same time, I think, and appropriate to. I'm in a Vineyard church. We're good charismatics. I mean, you gotta, like, recognize some spirits and pray for deliverance and cast out demons and, you know, take seriously the sort of the spiritual dimension of what's going on. But I would just hope to be inviting people, whether it's through, you know, whatever sort of reflection they're engaged in, to be looking for ways to hold their whole world together so that they can live forward in all three of those sorts of modes.",

And Paul's thought, why am I taking it for granted that I know what kind of being that that is? Maybe it's a being that exists in a way that's a very different kind of personal being than I am. And, yeah, Matt's work shows that there's actually lots of different ways to talk about a Personal being, being real. But that isn't a person like I am. That's helpful to me.

And Matt's work has given me some very helpful categories to critique my previously held assumptions about how I read and even think about any of this in the Bible.
