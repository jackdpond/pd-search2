The noun anointed one, Mashiach, it occurs three times in Leviticus to refer to the high priest. And then if you're just looking for the distribution of those occurrences, it goes from three hits in Leviticus. Excuse me, four. Four hits in Leviticus.

So in other words, the vast majority, 3/4 or even more of all of the occurrences of the word Messiah in the Hebrew Bible are somehow related to the story of David as told in Samuel and then reflected upon within the Psalm scroll, where David is a major figure. So if you want to talk about the Anointed in the Hebrew Bible, you got to talk about the high priest, then you got to talk about David, and then you got to talk about the role that David plays within both the prophets and the writings in the Psalms. So that's what we're going to do. In these two episodes that lay ahead. We reflected on the Samuel story of David last episode, and you're right, the portrait is surprising. Israel wants a king, and so they get a king according to their own desires in the person of Saul, who's the first Anointed one. But he turns out to be like another Adam and Eve who does what's good in his eyes, and so he forfeits his opportunity to rule as God's image. And so Yahweh chooses another anointed one, and that's David. And the key portrait that I wanted to focus our attention on was the image of David being privately anointed as becoming the heaven on earth representative of God's rule in Israel. But he consistently. Well, that private anointing slowly starts to become evident to others, especially to the reigning King Saul. And it becomes this long story of God's real Anointed One waiting patiently through persecution and suffering from his own brothers wandering in the wilderness, hiding in caves, waiting for God to exalt him. He's not going to take matters into his own hands. And that's where we kind of left things last time. So that portrait of the suffering patient, anointed one who waits for God to bring about his public exaltation, that's like, crucial to this theme of the Anointed One in the story of David, the.",

  {
    "text": "Cool. I'm glad you highlighted that, because I wasn't thinking about that. And that seems really key. And it's interesting that the. Yeah, the way that Samuel. The Samuel scroll would tell the story really does focus on this in between state where David's anointed, but he's not yet king, and how he deals with that.",
    "start": "00:08:01",
    "end": "00:08:23"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah. 15 chapters from 1st Samuel, 16 to the end of the scroll in chapter 31. And Saul dies in that last chapter. And then. Oh, remember, first and Second Samuel are divided up as separate books in our Bibles, but they are one continuous literary work. So Two, Samuel begins with David lamenting over the death of Saul, even though the guy was chasing him, trying to kill him, you know, for the last few years. And then the tribes come around him and make David king. So what's up with that? Why is the narrative giving so much airtime to this long period of suffering waiting? There must be something about the way that God's heavenly rule is brought to earth through that kind of anointed figure must be really important to these authors. And as we're going to see, that same idea of this patient waiting, suffering, Anointed one is the same idea brought forward in the Isaiah scroll, which we'll look at in this conversation and also in the portrait of David and his future seed in the Psalms scroll, which we'll look at in the next. And the reason, again for doing this is when we turn to the New Testament, Christ Messiah Anointed one is the main title applied to Jesus by the New Testament authors, not by Jesus himself. He avoided the title, but people use it of him. And so the question is, what is that word supposed to conjure up in our imaginations? Like, what are the backstories, the. That we are to see there? And so that's what I'm trying to help us fill in, that the Hebrew Bible gives us a pretty robust backstory around someone who got the oil of God's heavenly oil and spirit poured upon them so they can represent him on earth. So with that, I'm going to turn our attention to an important promise that God made to David that is going to be really important for understanding the theme of the anointed servant in the scroll of Isaiah. So an important moment in David's story is after he patiently waits and he's exalted in God's time to become king over the tribes. In 2 Samuel chapter 7, David has now established Jerusalem as the capital city. He brought the tabernacle that Moses, you know, oversaw the construction, the Ark of the Covenant. He brought it there, and that was a bumpy ride to get it there, but he eventually did. And second Samuel, chapter seven begins with David expressing this desire to God that he wants to make God a really nice palace. Like, I've got a capital city, you know, why should Yahweh still live in that old tent that wandered around the wilderness? Yeah, it's a couple centuries old now, maybe pretty tattered.",

    "text": "Yeah, that's my paraphrase. But he says, did I ever ask or tell any of the leaders of Israel to make me a house? Like, I'm good with the tent. And then God flips it and he says, I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you. I'm going to build you a house using the same word. So the word a house in Hebrew, it's bayat, can refer to a physical building. It's the word for the temple, the house of Yahweh. But it also can refer to a household, the way we would use that word in English, meaning the people or family. So he says, I'm going to build you a house. And then these are key words that are going to be kind of like a launching pad for the development of the hoped for anointed servant, both in Isaiah and in the Psalm scroll. So this is Second Samuel seven, eight. Now this is what you will say to my servant, David. God's talking to his prophet Nathan, saying, go say this to David. This is what Yahweh of hosts says, I took you from the pasture, from behind the sheep, to be ruler over my people, Israel. I have been with you wherever you have gone.

So when God chooses and selects a special covenant partner out of the many, one way of describing that intimate bond is the father son language. Okay, so that's all the good stuff about this king. So I'll be a father to him, he'll be a son to me. When he commits iniquity, I will correct him with a human rod and with the strokes of the sons of Adam. So when the seed that comes from you, if they blow it, then I'm going to let some other humans come and whoop them, strike them, and it'll be my allowing it to happen. It'll be God's correction. But he says, my loyal love will not depart from your seed like I took it away from Saul, who I removed from before you. Your house and your kingdom will endure before me forever, your throne established forever. Amen. And amen. So what you learn here is that if any of the seed from the line of David violates this covenantal bond or blows it in some way, then God's going to correct them, but his loyal love won't depart from the lineage. So this is setting you up for the whole story of David's sons who rule in Jerusalem and starting with Solomon. And he's going to be like, yeah, it's me. And then he goes on to God says, here, commit iniquity. And so it's as if just like Adam and Eve or just like Saul, they forfeit the opportunity for themselves to be that ruler. But what God says is, my loyal love won't depart from your seed. It's just the opportunity gets passed to the next generation. And that's how the pattern of stories works through the Book of Kings.

So we don't have time to trace the whole theme through Isaiah, but I thought we could touch down and sample a few passages because they're awesome and because Jesus and the authors of his story in the Gospels definitely thought that these texts were awesome. So I'll begin with one text that we've read many times over the years. So I don't know how long this will take. I always say let's just go briefly. It's never brief, but this is in Isaiah, chapter 11. The first main kind of block literary movement in Isaiah is chapters 1 through 39 or 1 to 35, but 1 through 12 is kind of the first symphony movement, as it were. And this poem right here that we're going to read is the culmination to one of the first major units in Isaiah. And in the paragraph right before this, Yahweh is going to bring that human rod in the form of Assyria to come start chopping down the forests of Judah. That's the image here. So when all of Israel and Judah is getting laid low and cut down, what we learn in Isaiah 11:1 is that a little shoot. A branch will emerge out from the stump of Jesse, father of David is the father of David, and a branch from its roots will bear fruit. So we're depicting a future fruit branch.",

It's a revealing of a kind of reality that's in continuity with our world, but also feels just fundamentally different. Which is why by the end of the scroll of Isaiah, this very picture right here will get called the new heavens and the new land, the new Jerusalem that I will create. That's what God says. But part of what makes it the bold hope that it is also is the poetic form, because poetry is a kind of language that evokes your imagination as much as it tries to communicate an idea or a body of information. So I think it is supposed to send our minds to high places, up to the heavens. So what an Iron Age Israelite living in Jerusalem thought about this, I have no idea. But what Isaiah and all the Bible nerd scribes and prophets who treasured these poems and collected them into the scrolls that we have in the Hebrew Bible, they. This is what kept them going, man. And this is clearly the kind of imagery that energized Jesus and his first followers. So what's interesting about this portrait is that the only real conflict at work in the scene is that there's oppressed people and bad guys, and the king is going to rescue the oppressed and judge the bad guys, and then it's just peace in the land. That's the image here. So this is the image attached to the king and to the people of Israel in the storyline of the Bible. Problem is, and Isaiah assumes that you've already read the whole story of the line of David in Samuel and then in the scroll of the Kings. And what you know is that aside from a few bright spots like Hezekiah or Josiah, it all crashed and burned. And Yahweh handed over his people and his city and the temple to destruction and allowed Babylon to destroy it all and take many Israelites into exile. And so how do you process and explain that with these bold promises on the table? Did Yahweh not mean what he said? Or is there some other explanation? So what you get in the latter parts of the book of Isaiah is this reflection on what was the meaning of the downfall of Jerusalem. And what about that promise that God made to David? And what about the promise, like, right here in Isaiah 11? And so some interesting things start to happen in relationship to the anointed figure. And I'm just going to trace a few poems here. In Isaiah 1 is in chapter 42, and the poet introduces us to a figure called, Sorry, this is all in the voice of Yahweh. Behold my servant, whom I uphold, My chosen one, in whom my soul delights.

I appoint you as a covenant for the people, as a light to the nations, to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the dungeon and those who dwell in the darkness out of prison.

They will be the covenant faithfulness that the people have failed to ever demonstrate. And in so doing, this figure will become that shining light to the nations. And then all the imagery about opening blind eyes and bringing out prisoners. So light shining in the darkness, that's God's glory shining on day one from the seven day creation story. Now this figure is going to become that glorious light shining in the darkness to release people out of prison and to become the covenant faithfulness of what God had purposed for Israel. So as you go through these poems in the latter part of Isaiah, you see that this anointing is about one figure being filled up with God's heavenly life, liquid life of spirit, to become the vehicle of heavenly light and blessing on behalf of Israel.

He's the branch, like a root out of the parched ground, the root of Jesse. He had no form or majesty that we should pay any attention to him. He didn't have any kind of appearance that we would be attracted to him. In fact, it was just the opposite. He was despised. He was forsaken by people. He was actually a man of sorrows.

Somehow that rule is going look like somebody who is rejected, isn't honorable in the eyes of important people. And he identifies with people in their suffering and grief. That's the picture here. So that's Isaiah 53. And eventually this guy goes to his death like they described that this guy who we thought was abandoned by God. The speaking voice says, we thought that he was cursed by God. Like, that's what we thought about this guy. And then in verse five, it pivots and the voice says, but in reality, he was pierced and killed and crushed and suffered for our. That is Israel's transgressions for our iniquities. And the punishment that brought us shalom fell upon him. And it's by his wounds that we have found healing. So this speaking group is identifying that this anointed figure is actually going to experience on Israel's behalf all of the disasters and the suffering and hardship that Israel has experienced and was destined for by failing to live as God's covenant partners. And that this figure would become the Covenant for the people. So he would both embody the Covenant faithfulness of the people while at the same time shouldering all of the consequences for the failure of the Covenant people. And that's, again, the role of this anointed one, which is a lot like David. It's as if David shouldered Saul's failures.",

That's what we talked about in the last episode. But instead, he just suffers Saul's folly and whatever insanity for years. So it's like he's suffering for Saul's sins. That's the portrait of David in Samuel. And those are the ideas that are getting picked up and developed here. But now of the future seed from the line of David. So where this poem ends, I mean, we could spend, and one day we should spend many episodes in the scroll of Isaiah. You think that this anointed servant is just gone, dead and gone, but all of a sudden, down in verse 10 of chapter 53, after he's given his life as a guilt offering, he all of a sudden is going to look upon his seed, he's going to have like offspring, and he will see them, and he will prolong his days, and the good pleasure of Yahweh will prosper in his hand.

And now, by his knowledge, he used to know suffering and grief. Now, verse 11, by his knowledge, the righteous one, my servant, will declare the many to be righteous while he bears their iniquities. So he suffers on behalf of Israel's failures and then reconstitutes a group of people called the seed, to be the righteous covenant partners that they have never been, but that the servant was on their behalf. So that's where the portrait of the suffering anointed servant goes in the scroll of Isaiah. And we could look at many more poems, but you get the idea. So what's truly remarkable is that when you turn to the Psalms scroll in the Hebrew Bible, it's this exact same portrait of David as an image of a suffering, vindicated, anointed one of Yahweh who suffers but also brings light and life to the nations.
