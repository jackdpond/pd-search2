You know, you shouldn't be amazed, Nicodemus, when I say to you that you must be born anothen from above. And of course, the assumed is that God's heavenly presence is up on high. And so if he sends a spirit, he sends it from above. From above. He says, the wind blows where it wishes. You hear the sound. But man, you can't predict it. You don't know. It's mysterious how the spirit works. And Nicodemus is like, what are you talking about? How is this possible? Jesus goes on to say, listen, if I start talking to you about earthly things, fleshy things, and you don't believe me, how will you believe me if I start talking to you about things from above? Heavenly things. And then he starts talking about how he's from above coming down to bring God's truth and eternal life. And God so loved the world that he sent his son from above. So this whole conversation is about how God provides his heavenly life and spirit to rebirth humanity from above. The sun comes down from above. The spirit comes from above.

So what Jesus is doing is he's drawing on a deep, deep association in Jewish tradition that comes from the Hebrew Bible where God's heavenly spirit that is poured out onto the land to bring about life is a core motif that begins that we studied in the Garden of Eden story, where the role of God's spirit in the seven day creation narrative and then the role of God's spirit linked with the water in the Garden of Eden story, with the birth of the human is a really key image. And what's interesting is that link between the water and the spirit, the that's associated there, it's implicit in Genesis 2. It starts to get drawn upon throughout the rest of the Hebrew Bible. So Jesus isn't just riffing off of Genesis 2. He's also got passages like Isaiah 44, 3 on the brain. When God promises to the exiles in Babylon, he's going to restore them. And that restoration is described in this way. I will pour out water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground. And you're like, oh yeah, like you did, just plant the Garden of Eden. Parallel lines. I will pour out my spirit on your offspring and my blessing on your seed or your descendants.

In the story of Noah, when God cleansed the world through the flood, the first new growth on the earth was an olive branch brought back to the ark by a dove. This signified that the new world was ready to be populated again under God's new covenant with Noah. The olive branch reminds me of the significance of olive oil in anointing. In the New Testament, when Jesus was baptized, the dove of the Spirit alights on on him when he comes up out of the water as well. Do you think that the significance of the spirit appearing like a dove on Jesus was to point back to the promise given to Noah of a new earth and a new covenant and to point to God's divine anointing of his Son in this moment? Thanks for everything you do.",

The reason why I put John and Stephanie's questions kind of up at the front is they both are great examples of how when you're reading something in the Gospels and you have that feeling like, I've been here before or this sounds familiar. And oftentimes what will come up is one main passage. So, Stephanie, for you, these little details of the flood story where as the dry land is emerging out of the water, you have a dove and why the olive branch? You know? Yeah. What's that about? So this is another example where the flood story is participating is one of many links in a chain where birds, waters, olives, or oil are linked together in anointing or purification stories. So I want to high five Stephanie and then show how that actually, the flood story is itself riffing off of something that came before the flood and then where it goes after that.

And then there will often be either water mixed with blood or olive oil mixed with blood that becomes part of purifying, and then that gets sprinkled or poured over the one to be rebirthed or purified, and then they're pronounced clean. In other words, the author of Leviticus is portraying the purification of Israelites on analogy or parallel to the purification of the land.",

    "text": "And so I'm trying to back up and say, where did such an idea even come from if it appears in the Revelation? The whole point is, has a long prehistory in the biblical story, and we're getting to the roots of it here. So the phrase anti anointed. Antichristos is a Greek compound phrase. It's actually the compound of a preposition in Greek, anti, which we get anti, which means the opposite. Something in the place of or against, like over against. And it kind of means Saul is all of those. So anointed. Our core image in the video is anointing. To be anointed is to be a heavenly person who's marked out as a bridge between heaven and earth because God's heavenly life has been poured out on you through the spirit. And that's symbolized by the anointing Oil. So the core idea is of a heaven on earth, spot or place or person. So Saul, in the case of Saul, he is given opportunity to be an anointed, and he functions as the anointed, the first part of his story. But then once he goes through his failure at the tree of decision, he has a few of them, then his life begins to fall apart and God raises up another anointed in his place. And the twist of the Saul story is the rest of his life gets spent thinking that he's still the anointed one, opposing and threatening and trying to kill the actual anointed one. You get two anointed ones and you get one who's real and the other one who's anti. So your question, Joseph, is does somebody need to be an anointed to become an anti anointed? To become an anti anointed. And it seems like that's kind of the logic of the story. In other words, the anti anointed is a term to describe somebody who looks like, sounds like, thinks they are and anointed, we're part of the anointed, but in fact they are working in opposition to the real purposes of God. And what's interesting is that is how the term is used again in the New Testament, but outside the revelation. This phrase appears in the letter of First John in a really interesting way. So the setting of First John is of a network of house churches that John the Elder oversaw or helped plant. We don't know, maybe around the region of Ephesus people debate these things. But you know, the letter says that there's a group of followers of Jesus who split the church and left because they don't acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah. Son of God become human, come in the flesh is what he says. And so a group broke off and now there's hostility between the two groups. And he describes that group. Well, he says it in chapter two. He says chapter two, verse 18. He says, children, it is the last hour. Just as you have heard, the anti Messiah is coming. Even now many anti Messiahs have already appeared. And by this we know it's the final hour because they went out from us, but they were not really from us. For if they had been from us, they would have remained with us. But the fact that they went out was to show us that they are not from us. So in this case it's clearly we thought they were of the Messiah, but in reality they don't confess Jesus as the Son of God become human. So they are actually unto anointed okay.",

So you have these kind of alternate portraits of the humanity anointed from the beginning, but then the real anointed that God will raise up to crush the snake. And so there's just this inversion or mirror opposites of the true versus the anti anointed. And so in a way, that's kind of what Cain and Abel represent or what Joseph and his brothers represent, or what Moses and his brother represent. Because remember, Moses is the one really interceding for Israel up on the mountain, whereas his brother, the anointed, one high priest, is down making idols at the foot of the mountain. Right. And so there's this pattern of that it's difficult to tell the true anointed one from the anti anointed, or that there's always these opposite forces and representative humans working throughout history. And so in the same way in the Revelation picks up on motifs from Daniel and the prophets about human systems like the city of Cain or the empires of Nimrod coming together in the new mega Babylon to oppose the purposes of God. And that's the driven by the spirit of the anti anointed. But in reality, there's the real anointed who are the people of the Lamb who are willing to exercise their power like David as the anointed ones, by suffering and surrendering their lives so that the kingdom of God can be built through suffering, love. And that's how you know the difference between the anointed and the anti anointed. And then different Christian traditions try to nail down, well, maybe this will be focused on a particular person and a time and predict the dates and what government they'll come from.

We're given God's divine breath and God's heavenly life poured out on us that we never asked for but just received here. So in one sense. And every human is called to be that image of God partner, to recognize they have some kind of agency and calling in the world. Some of those human image of God's partners find themselves for certain seasons of their lives in places of great influence. And there is an extra responsibility there. And man, for those who are really in tune with the generous love of the God whom they image. Man, this is really cool stuff can happen. Like life of heaven can get poured out on earth, but the opposite can happen. In the end, they can become an embodiment of anti anointed. And I think those are images that are developed in the early Genesis stories. They get expressed throughout the storyline. So in a way it's like a set of clothes or a set of roles that all of us are playing out in our own lives. And that also get played out in the drama of human history in the ebb and the rise and fall of institutions and governments and cities and empires.

In the Gospel of Luke, chapter seven, and in the Gospel of John, chapter 12, what we hear of is of Jesus feet being anointed. In Luke, it's a woman who's just called the sinful woman, and she wipes Jesus feet with her hair. And then in John 12, it's Mary in Bethany, but it's his feet. Then you get two stories, one in Mark, chapter 14, and one in Matthew, chapter 26, and it's Jesus head being anointed by someone called Mary at Bethany. And Jesus connects us to his coming burial.

    "text": "And so it's sort of like an inverted anointing story, Jesus style, where his arrival into a seat of power and influence is his death anointing. At the same time, I also have wondered then if, because anointing for burial is connected to what you would do in a grave, that there's something about Jesus', you know, he's going to descend to the grave. And so the anointing for burial is like that, but that descent to the grave is inverted by his ascent into cosmic rule, you know, in his resurrection and then ascension. So I think the point maybe to answer both Demetric and Joshua's question, is this is a creative twist on the Hebrew Bible patterns of anointing, but not in a way that dismisses them. It's a creative inversion to make a powerful point that it's through Jesus death that he becomes king, that he becomes the king, the true anointed one who unites heaven and earth, but by giving his life instead of taking or seizing it through violent power. It's powerful stuff. So there you go. Now we officially talked about that story. Do you have any other thoughts or observations about that?",

    "text": "No. It seems par for the course for the Bible to do twists and turns with a theme, you know, and then it seems par for the course for the Gospel authors to say the way that you're. The way that power comes and true rule comes is upside down. And so what a beautiful moment where the anointing theme gets this little twist.",

I realized I never cited this in our conversations, but if anyone is interested in anointing in the ancient world or in the history of the church, a number of questions came up that we didn't have time to get to about how the anointing ritual lived on in Christian church history, where we started. Yeah. So there's an excellent volume that I learned a lot from in researching for this. It's an edited essay collection called the Oil of Anointing in the Christian Tradition, edited by a church historian, Martin Dudley. We'll put a link, I think, in the show notes for the podcast. But it's like everything from anointing in ancient Mesopotamia to the Greek and Roman world to Israel, early church, and then, like, in the history of Catholicism or in Orthodoxy or in Eastern Orthodoxy, we're in the Catholic Church and Anglicanism and different Protestant. It's everything all in one.",
