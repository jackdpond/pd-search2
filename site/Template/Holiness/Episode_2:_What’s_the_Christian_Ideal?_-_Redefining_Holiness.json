    "text": "Hi, this is John at the bibleproject. We've been working on a lot of things here at the bibleproject, and one of those things that you might be familiar with is a series of videos on YouTube called theme videos. Theme Videos are biblical motifs, biblical ideas that you could take and trace from the beginning of scripture all the way to the end. It's a theme that develops. It has its own story arc, and it always culminates in Jesus and finds its climax in him. We have about a dozen theme videos on our YouTube channel now, and we have plans for another dozen to complete that series. These themes are so deep and rich that we can't cover all of it in a five minute animated video. These podcast conversations help fill those out. But another project we want to do is. Is to make workbooks that accompany every single theme video. We've been working on this project. We made a beta workbook on the theme of heaven and Earth. We printed about 5,000 of those, and we sent them out to some of our supporters to test them out with groups. We're getting feedback on those right now. So thank you for doing that. And we're also starting to lay the groundworks for another workbook on the theme of holiness. And that's what this podcast is going to be about. As we thought about this workbook on holiness and what the big takeaways were, we decided we needed to have a conversation to flesh it all out. So we turned on the mics and recorded that conversation. You're going to hear a new voice on this podcast. His name is Paul Pastor. He's a colleague of ours and he's an author, and he's helping us write this workbook on holiness. So why holiness? Well, holiness is a confusing and loaded word. It's a word we don't use in common English. At least I don't. But it's a word we constantly use in religious settings. God is holy. I want to be holy. Holy, holy, holy. What do we actually mean when we're saying holy? There's a negative connotation to holiness, where someone's holier than thou, detached, stuffy, and stuck up. Is that what we mean? Or is it something else entirely?",

    "text": "Who actually knows how to write, and that's Paul. So Paul has been talking with us about the next workbook, which is going to be on the theme of holiness. And as we were getting ready, we wanted to have a discussion about one aspect that we think will kind of ground the conversation, which is, well, we were calling it the ideal. So this idea of God's holiness, I mean, let's back up. Holiness is a really abstract term. And for our purposes, the shorthand is we're talking about it as God's otherness, his uniqueness. I don't know, Tim, why don't you actually give, like, the summary?",
    "start": "00:03:42",
    "end": "00:04:23"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Well, so, yeah, holiness in the Bible, it's a foreign concept to modern Western people's view, and it doesn't match our vocabulary or many concepts we already have in our head. So in the Bible, most religious people, if they know the word, they connect holiness with moral behavior or if they've made it through Leviticus and internalized it some. They'll connect holiness with something about being set apart or God or people being set apart from common use. And so holiness, essentially, I think, in most people's understanding, is about being a good person and being set apart from bad things, which is one of those things where, yeah, okay, that's part of it, but that's just one part. And that one part actually doesn't really even make very much sense without a much bigger picture and within a larger story. So that's what we did in the holiness video. And then we wanted to unpack what it means for God to be holy and then what it means for people to participate in God's holiness. And how Jesus fits into that. So there you go. It has something to do with being set apart.",

But there's something more there. There's the presence of something.",

    "text": "Yeah, I don't know who that is. So he goes on to say, holiness is often defined as one, either one separation. Objects consecrated for use in the temple or tabernacle are removed or set apart. And then he says, however, separation doesn't get us to the essence of the meaning of holiness because it fails to provide any content to what it means for something to be holy or set apart in the first place. And then he says, second, holiness and morality or ethics are often so equated that people use the terms synonymously. Like, and this is where we get the phrase holier than thou in English, where holier than thou usually refers to a religious person who thinks that they live more morally than other people.",

It's his righteousness, his goodness, his generosity, and so on. So then he says this. He says, in Israel's Canaanite neighbors, they wrote lots of literature and their gods are often called holy. And then he notes this. It's fascinating. He says, in Canaanite literature, things that are not divine but connected with the divine or the spirit realm are, Are often called holy, like trees or streams or burial grounds, sacred objects that are closely related to the gods and the spirit world. And then he talks about how in many of the Psalms in the Old Testament, God's holiness is used and described along with adjectives like majestic, glorious, awesome, awe inspiring and beautiful. And he says that's where we should start. Is this idea of beauty and power and goodness got it as the core meaning of holiness.",

    "text": "So, okay, cool. And that brings us back to, I think what we wanted to focus on for this conversation is to say, what is that? What is like this ultimate good? What is an ideal kind of state of perfection? Is a word we probably will start throwing around in a way. But if God is holy because he is these things, he is the manifest awesome goodness, and if he created creation, the universe to be that, what does that look like? What is that state? What is this ideal? What does the Bible have to say about what it means to be in a state of perfection?",

So it's God's status as the creator of this world that itself is beautiful and amazing and awe inspiring. And it's just a manifestation of how much more amazing and awe inspiring the beautiful mind that designed it is. So that's. Yeah, the idea is God's the ultimate of everything, right? And so what we want to focus on is not just morality and not just being set apart, but that all those things are really ways. The Bible is saying we can participate in something transcendent and beautiful like that thing, that it's only God, but that is something that God wants to invite people into. And so that's what we want to get at. That's where we want to start. The workbook is to be in touch with. Most humans have an intuitive sense that there is something transcendent or beautiful that we sometimes attain to or something ethical and good and noble, the right thing to do, but that I only sometimes do or only halfway do.

But if holiness is just one term to describe like this, this moment of realizing the otherness of something that you're in the presence of, then it's really just one. One approach to begin talking about a much bigger set of ideas. And so I sometimes wonder, is this workbook really on holiness or is it on this bigger idea of being made for something grand? The ideal longing for it and experiencing it sometimes. And that experience being the sense of holiness and then a call to our lives to participate in it and a sense of awe and reverence for the author of it. All of these ideas are what we're really going to be talking about. Possibly. And so holiness just becomes one way to begin the conversation. Or are we strictly going to be just talking about the term, the word, the vocabulary of holiness.",

It strikes me we've had conversations about this before, but the Bible, at specific intervals throughout its story, gives the people of God an image that they can see. God's holiness. The temple of meeting, the Tabernacle, the temple. And then of course, that's reinterpreted later as Jesus and then the body of Christ. So we. We get all of these reminders of what that space of abundance imaged as the Garden of Eden, really, in Genesis, of what that is like to actually see it in our lives, to actually be able to encounter it, be able to experience it.",

And he's summarizing the Old Testament on holiness. And he summarizes these characteristics of the divine in this way. Awe, majesty, vitality, otherness and compelling fascination are the way he summarizes the character traits in the Old Testament that make God holy. And then wait, the trait is fascination. Compelling fascination. So what he's saying is when people have these encounters with the holy God, like Isaiah or Moses, compelling fascination.

The priestly tradition, and he means here, Exodus, Leviticus, numbers requires a response of purity and cleanness. But then he says the prophetic tradition demands a response of social justice, a social cleanness or social purity. The wisdom books stress the cleanness of our inner integrity and individual moral acts. That was kind of helpful to say different parts of the Bible call towards a different realization of the ideal.",
