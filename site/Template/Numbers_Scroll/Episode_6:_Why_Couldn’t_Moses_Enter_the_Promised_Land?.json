Exodus, of course, was their journey out of Egypt to Mount Sinai. And then Mount Sinai takes up the center of the Torah at the end of Exodus, all of Leviticus. And then as you walk into the Numbers scroll, the first movement is about Israelites preparing to leave Mount Sinai and then leaving as a mobile Eden camp. It's like a mobile garden with Yahweh's Tabernacle at the center. So the first movement, which is chapters one through 12, is about their arranging the camp as a series of concentric circles around the little Eden spot in the middle, which is the Tabernacle in the holy of holies. And so that was about the arrangement of the camp and then how the camp is to remain a place of purity and life and holiness as they travel. And then that movement ended with chapters 10, 11, 12, with them actually leaving Mount Sinai one calendar year later after they camped out there. So that's the first movement. And that movement ends with signs of how this road trip is going to go, because they're supposed to go on a road trip from Sinai to the land that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob lived in, the land that was promised to those ancestors to be a place where Israel would be fruitful and multiply and become a conduit of God's blessing to the nations. And so in the second movement, they are on their way. And things don't go well. From the first narratives, after they leave are about the people grumbling and complaining, not trusting God. And we've then been covering. In the second movement, which goes from chapters 13 to 25, there is a sequence all told in the Wilderness Journeys, there's a sequence of seven rebellion narratives where the people grumble or don't trust God. And it cycles through those three concentric circles around the camp. The outer circle was all the tribes. Then inside of that was a circle which was the Levites. And then the center circle is the tabernacle itself, where just the priests and the high priests can go in. And so in this middle section of Numbers, the second movement, the rebellion narratives go from people from the outer circle keep, like, honing in. So the story of the Rebellion of the Spies is about one of the spies is from each tribe. That was the first circle around the camp. So that lair rebels and God tells them, great, fine, then you won't enter the land if you don't want to. And they don't want to go into the land because there are giants there that they think will squash them.",

And so that leaves now the center circle, the tabernacle itself, and the people who operate within that are Moses and Aaron, the high priest, and the two sons of Aaron.

One other thing to note in this section, numbers 13 to 25, is there's a symmetrical shape to this whole section, or a chiasm shape. The rebellion of the spies takes place as the spies are sent out from a region or a place called Kadesh, which is spelled with the Hebrew letters for holiness. So they're sent out from the holy place. The spies go into the land, and they don't trust God, and so they are excluded from the land. And then after that, the spies and the Israelites say, oh, no, we're sorry, God, we'll go into the land after all. And then God says, no, you already made your choice. And the people go into the land anyway. And they're defeated by Canaanites and Amalekites at a place called Horma. So what's going to happen then is here, then we have the next rebellion, which is of the Levites against the priests. Then once we turn to chapter 20.

So there's a parallelism between the rebellion of the spies. Both what happens and where it happens is replayed in Chapter 20 of Numbers with the rebellion of Moses. So it's. Yeah, it has like A, A, B, A structure where A is the rebellion of the spies at Kadesh because they don't believe in the canon of the land. B is the rebellion of the Levites. Then once we come to Moses, we're back at A again, a rebellion at Kadesh of Moses and Aaron. They don't trust, and they too will not get to enter the land.

    "end": "00:12:32"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah. No. Yeah. It's not just literary art for art's sake, though it is definitely a creative expression. The point of literary design of Hebrew Bible literature, from how biblical authors construct sentences and lines to how they construct collections of paragraphs into units and then into movements into whole scrolls, is they're constantly designing things in symmetrical patterns, not just so that you notice it, but so you begin to compare things with other things. So the fact that the rebellion of the spies happens at Kadesh, it's. The people don't trust and so they don't enter the land, is set in design parallelism to Moses and Aaron's rebellion at Kadesh, the same place. They don't have trust and they don't enter the land. And so the design is inviting you to hold those two Narratives which are seven chapters apart in our modern chapters, but to bring them as if they're next to each other in your mind, and then read them both as if they're back to back and meditate on the similarities and the differences. And so oftentimes, biblical authors will put little puzzles or little riddles where they will introduce intentional ambiguities into one narrative, and those ambiguities will be answered or clarified by things that they've designed in the matching story. And so this story about Moses and Aaron's lack of trust is a good example because it's illuminated by comparing it to its parallel, which is the rebellion of the spies. So actually, here, let's just do it, because the goal is actually, it's an invitation to the reader to gain more insight into the narratives through the literary design parallelism. But here let's just jump into the story of Moses and Aaron's failure, and I think you'll see some of the payoffs. Sam, Numbers, Chapter 20. Then the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed at Kadesh.",

    "text": "Yep, totally. And so I think what the clues that the author gives is that by comparing it to the earlier Exodus 17 story, what we're highlighting is that the command that God gave in this instance was different. We're not told why, but God didn't tell Moses to do what he did in Exodus 17. He gave him a new set of instructions for this moment. And Moses, he doesn't do what God says. That's so clearly the way the narrative is designed to lead you up to that third moment of like, oh, he obeyed God's word and wanted to. So I think we're back to this theme in the melody all the way Back to Genesis 1, where God's word is life. God's word is the way to life. Yeah, that's what God speaking 10 times in creation is all about. God's word is what sustains and generates life out of non life. And then in the Eden story, following the word of God is what allows God's partners to continue enjoying the gift of abundant Eden life. So that true life is still a gift from God's word in the Eden story. So that sets up this motif. And so the idea of people doing what God says. Exactly. And it leads to life, that's a major theme in the Flood story when God gives Noah all the commands about how to build the Eden box. And it's been a major theme here in Numbers where God said, hey, don't be afraid. Go into the land. I'm going to deliver the giants into your hand. And the people don't trust. In fact, God's accusation against the people back in rebellion of the spies is exactly the same thing of what God says to Moses here. You didn't trust me and you didn't treat me as the holy one in the eyes of the people.",

So I'm with you in terms of for many years, I had the same reaction. I was like, what's the big deal? But the design of this story, the two parallel stories that are hyperlinked, are meant to slowly help us focus on the moment that Moses did the opposite of what God told him to do. And you remember how we kind of had this feeling back in Leviticus when the sons of Aaron take the incense, you know, and waltz into the tent, like it's theirs to waltz into and the narrator said they did what Yahweh had not commanded them to do. And these are the people selected out of the tribe of Levi who were selected out of the Israelites to be the image of God representatives on behalf of all the people. So the stakes are higher. The closer you operate to the tent, the stakes are higher. And so there's a severe consequence for Moses and Aaron because of the position that God has elevated them to. And so I think those are all factors that are really there in the text that are highlighting why Moses gets this severe consequence. Moses is, like, the best person we've had in the story so far. He's not perfect, but he's the only character who's ascended heaven in the biblical story. Oh, except Enoch back in Genesis.",

This whole story is about God selecting a special partner out of the many and then giving more, first of all, more generous abundance to them. And also more instruction, more clarity about God's purpose and will and desire. And so to those to whom this is. What is this, Spider Man? You know, to those. What is it? With great power comes great responsibility. You can't believe I'm quoting a Marvel movie at this point in our conversation. But that is naming a dynamic at work in the story. And so what the narrative is doing is it's saying God selects humans, gives them an instruction, they don't do it, and they bring death on themselves instead of life and blessing, which was what was on offer. And then the next generation steps up to the plate, and the biblical story just keeps repeating. So God selects a whole family, and then God selects one tribe out of that family. Then God selects one clan out of that tribe, and it's Moses and Aaron. And they have received more instruction and logged more time with Yahweh face to face, especially Moses, than anybody. And I think that's what we're meant to feel. And, you know, Moses didn't just mistake. I mean, when he gives his speech when God told him to speak, and he does speak, but he doesn't speak to the rock, he speaks to the people. And, you know, he's mad at them. You rebels, and he says, shall we bring forth water for you out of the rock? That's interesting. You know, and this is actually not the first time Moses has showed displeasure and anger about the role God gave him to be the leader of the people. We didn't talk about the story in the podcast conversations, but back in numbers 11, he actually asked God to kill him. I would rather die than have to lead these people anymore.",

So Moses is also depicted as like a character on the edge, along with the people, from the beginning to the end of the wilderness narratives. And then I think we're back to the first point, having gone through that or the first angle, which is to those whom God invests high degrees of power, influence, ability to represent him, God asks for a high degree of adherence to the divine will and instruction. And because what God is after is a human partner who. Whose heart and desire and will is the same as the divine will. Right? A human partner for whom God's will and their will are the same thing. And so now I'm thinking forward to depictions of the ideal servant, like in the Book of Isaiah. And there's a big emphasis on how the coming king from the line of David and that suffering servant will love to do God's will. And God's will is their pleasure. And so this is a big meta theme throughout the melody cycling through the Hebrew Bible. And so the fact that Moses has been so in sync with God's will through Exodus and Leviticus. And then here in numbers, it starts to crack and Moses begins to gripe about God's will, and then here, he just straight up doesn't do what God told him to do.",

    "text": "Yes. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So the last thing about why I don't think the takeaway from the story is we're walking on eggshells. The story of Israel selected out from among the nations and the story of the Torah and the prophets is all about how even when God selects a special one out, gives them more instruction, more revelation, more proximity to the divine presence than anybody else, and even they keep repeating the failed choices of Adam and Eve in every generation, leading to death. So the whole story is leading you to this crisis of, like, dude, where's a human partner that will do God's will, that leads to abundant life for themselves and for the many? And so that is the vocation that falls upon the expected coming royal servant, royal priest that is portrayed in the prophets. And that is exactly how Jesus presents himself and is presented in the Gospels as Israel's representative and humanity's representative. And this is really highlighted in the Gospel of John, where Jesus talks about how he's come to do the will of the Father, and the Father has given everything into my hand, and I do my father's work. What my father wants to do, that's what I do. That's a big theme in John, and he's tapping into this right here. Adherence to the divine will leads to true life, even when it looks like death.",

And so I think where we should walk away from this story is to say, man, what we need is a human partner for God who will do the divine will that leads to life for the many. Because if we don't have that mediator, even Moses can't rescue us, much less ourselves. That's what I think it means to read this in light of the kind of the messianic trajectory of the Hebrew Bible, as opposed to thinking like, oh man, I'm screwed. Yeah, which is. This is a study in human nature. And so you are. That is a takeaway. But that's not the end of the story, because God provides water even though Moses fails. And God keeps the promise of a future coming mediator, even though Moses fails. And I think that's where this story is meant to point our attention. After the failure of Moses, they start journeying to the east side of the Jordan river. And Aaron dies. And you're like, oh, bummer. Yeah, okay, Aaron's dead. And then right at the point where you think, okay, Moses is going to die, I think they're all going to die. And starting in numbers, chapter 21, you get all of these reversal twists after the third most climactic rebellion of Moses and Aaron. So chapter 21, at a place called Hormah, which is where the Israelites were defeated after the rebellion of the spies, a Canaanite king attacks them and God gives them victory. So the place of defeat has turned into a place of victory. Next you get another grumbling story about the people grumbling because of no water. And so. Oh, that's the story of the snakes and the bronze staff. Oh, dude, that story is so amazing. We don't have time. But then after the people grumble for no water, and that grumbling leads to death, Moses intercedes for them. And then the next story is about how God gives them a surprise well of water in the wilderness. So you get these pivots of grumbling leads to death. But then Moses mediates, and then that leads to water and life. And then chapter 21 ends with two giant kings, like two kings Og and Sichon, who were Amorite kings on the east side of the Jordan. They hear that Israel has marched into their territory and they come out to attack, and they're giants. And God gives them victory over the giants. And this is an ironic reversal because the spies were afraid of the giants, but now God gives them victory. So these become little reversals of the curse and death, even out here in the wilderness. And that leads up to the ultimate reversal at the climax of movement two, which is what we call numbers 22 through 25, which is a story which has this figure named Balaam at the center of it, who's a pagan sorcerer.",

Wow, it's really cool. So what's interesting is what we're taking.

Literally comparing Balaam to a talking ass. A talking donkey. Yeah, because there's a talking donkey in the story. But the literary design of the story is comparing Balaam as the talking pagan sorcerer to the talking donkey. And God speaks truth through an ass.

And what God does is he takes the three attempts of the king of Moab to curse through the sorcerer, and God turns the curse into a blessing in the mouth of the talking sorcerer who's compared to a talking donkey. So the king of Moab makes three attempts, and Balaam the sorcerer speaks three poems of blessing. And then after the third attempt, the king of Moab gets so mad that Balaam's just like, oh, three wasn't enough for you? Well, here's a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, and a seventh oracle.

This is numbers 24, 5. Balaam says, how tov. How good are your tents, O Jacob? How good are your dwellings, O Israel? Like valleys that stretch out like gardens beside a river. Like aloe trees planted by Yahweh, like cedar trees beside the waters? And you're like, oh, yeah, it's like Eden. So he's looking down at these migrant camps from a cliff, and they got.",

And Israel is going to have overflowing buckets, like buckets overflowing with water. And then the next line of the poem is, and his seed will be in the many waters. So the future seed of Israel coming out of this Eden life is like drops of water spilling up over an abundant bucket down onto the ground. So cool.
