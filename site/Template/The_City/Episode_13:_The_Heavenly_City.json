So we begin with the garden ideal of a heaven on earth spot with Eden. And it's safe and it's secure. It's a place where life is generated and preserved in peace because there's so much abundance and there's no threat of scarcity. And so because the humans foolishly forfeit the ability to stay in that garden ideal, they're exiled out into the wilderness. And in the next generation, you have the first murder with Cain. And Cain is exiled further from the garden and he fears for his life. And God wants to provide a sign that will protect him. But Cain instead goes and provides his own form of protection. And this is the origin of the city. And so what we traced is from Cain and then to his descendant. Lamech is the first human city. Also is a space that's dedicated for the preservation of life. That's why Cain built it. He's afraid somebody's going to kill him. But the ethical logic of that city is protect yourself from those who might harm you. And if that self preservation comes at the cost of another person's life, so be it. So be it. So you preserve life at the cost of life.

In other words, the heavenly presence of God takes on another layer, a new layer of imagery. You can call it the garden, or you can describe it as the heavenly city or Jerusalem. And when the earthly Jerusalem is being run and ruled and operating by the wisdom of God, it actually becomes an incarnation of the heavenly city and temple. But when its leaders lead it astray from that purpose, like Adam and Eve, but instead of being exiled from it, they just corrupt it. It's as if Adam and Eve stayed in the garden and began to just ruin the garden. And God let them until the point where it's just too much.

Let us build a city and a tower whose head is up in the skies. So they describe their city as if it's a kind of person that has a head and the head is up in the clouds. Now, head can be used metaphorically to talk about the top of things. So I might be making that up, but I might not be. But in this case, the heavenly ideal rule of God in the garden city above becomes a person. And Matthew wants us to see Jesus as that. That's why in the birth story with the wise men, he uses all the language of a passage from Isaiah about the new Jerusalem city, but describes Jesus as in the place of the city.

But he draws attention to a lot of scholarship done on Philippians that the colony cultural atmosphere of Philippi as an outpost of the Roman Empire is an important backdrop to a lot of the comments that he makes within the letter itself. Specifically here, a set of lines in Philippians Chapter three. He's contrasting in context about the way of life that's common in the city where they live.

But this is interesting. It's in Paul's letter to the Galatians. And I guess the important context for this passage we'll look at in Galatians 4 is that he's writing to a community of mostly non Israelite followers of Jesus. But there are some passionate followers of Jesus who are Israelites. And they really believe that to be part of the family of the Messiah of Israel, non Israelites need to, what do you say, conform their life to the basic practices of the Mosaic Torah and specifically Sabbath, kosher food laws, circumcision, keeping the liturgical calendar, and so on. Paul passionately disagrees. And he keeps referring to the stories of Abraham saying God's promise was that the family of God would be made up of all nations, and that the specific ways that God set apart Israel were for a time to keep Israel, Israel until the coming of Israel's Messiah. But that Messiah is for all nations. And so the defining entry card for membership in the family of the Messiah. And Abraham is just trusting in the Messiah and not these prescriptions of the Mosaic Torah. So that's the bigger context. So he goes into this reading and interpretation of the story of Abraham and Sarah and Hagar. It's really fascinating. So he goes, chapter four, verse 21.

But what he has in mind in the fact that the laws of the Torah and the covenant agreement didn't end up bringing eternal life to Israel. What it brought was continual cycles of breaking the divine command and then suffering the consequences for it in greater, greater scale, leading to present day Jerusalem, which is living under Roman occupation. And God's people living under foreign oppressors is one of the consequences for not living by the covenant made at Mount Sinai. So Mount Sinai didn't lead to the liberation of Israel. It led to their continual enslavement to foreign cities. And again, read Romans 6, 8 and his discussion of the Torah in Romans 3. That's what's in Paul's mind. So what led to Hagar and Ishmael? What came from Mount Sinai, what led to present day Jerusalem. It's all about humans trying to do by their own wisdom what they can never accomplish. You can't build a city up into the heavens. You can't produce a miraculous sun by your own scheming. You can't build an earthly city by the logic of Cain and Lamech and create the city of God. But he says the miraculous son from Sarah, that came from Sarah's womb, and he's for sure got a parallel to the virgin birth on his mind here, corresponds to the city of God that no human hands has made. And that city is our mother. That's what he says in verse 26. And here he's saying in different language the same thing he said to the Philippians, which is our citizenship, followers of Jesus, Messiah, which is a multi ethnic family that is itself the children of a city. That's our mom. That's his language here. And then he quotes from Isaiah 54, which is a poem about the heavenly Jerusalem depicted as a woman giving birth to a huge family. So this is a lot more complicated, clearly, because of these symbolic associations. But what I'm trying to say is one, in all these allegorical pairings, he's actually tracking with the design patterns at work within the authorially intended design of the Hebrew Bible, but then viewed also through the fulfillment of the story of Jesus.",

And that points forward as a bookend to the final scenes in Revelation 21 and 22, which is after the Babylon has fallen. Revelation 18. And evil is eradicated from God's world. Chapter 21, verse 1. Then I saw a new skies and a new land for the first skies, and the first land passed away. That's Genesis 1:1. New heaven and earth. There is no longer any sea, the chaos. No more of those dark, chaos waters. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven for God made ready as a bride. Here's the city as a woman again. That connects to all that stuff back from the Garden of Eden story. Then I heard a loud voice from the one on the throne saying, look, the tent of God, the tabernacle of God is now among humans, and he will tent dwell among them. They will be his people, and he will be their God. And then he goes on to take a tour of the city, of its walls, but with gates that are always open and never closed.",
