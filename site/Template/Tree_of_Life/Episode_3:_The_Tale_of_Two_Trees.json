And God says to Adam and Eve, eat of any of these trees, except there's one tree they're forbidden to eat from. It's called the Tree of Knowing Good and Evil. Eat of that tree and you'll die.

It's narrating the story in such a way that every human finds their own life experience within these representative characters. So it's doing both. It's also about me and my failures and how my failures participate in the whole human species failure as far back as we can tell. And that's where the what ifs become unhelpful, because they're interesting. I've never existed in a state of pure moral innocence, except maybe in my infancy, I guess. But David says, you know, even I was born. David looks at his life a failure and says, it's like I was born a failure. Yeah, that's what he says in Psalm 51. And I think there's an element of truth.
