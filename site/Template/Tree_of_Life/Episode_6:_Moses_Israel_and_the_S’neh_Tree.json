    "text": "Hey there. This is tim@the Bibleproject. And welcome to the Bibleproject podcast. If you've been tracking with this series on the tree of life, you'll know that we are following the theme of trees on high places throughout the storyline of the Bible. Today we are gonna arrive at a really interesting set of stories about Moses. Moses had some really important moments in front of trees, especially by bodies of water or on high places. We're going to look at two of these today. The first is a story of Moses and what has come in English to be called the story of the burning bush. And we're going to explore why that translation doesn't quite capture the whole meaning and significance of what this burning tree bush is all about. The second story we're going to look at is one of these odd short stories in the Bible. It's in Exodus, chapter 15. After the Israelites escaped from slavery in Egypt, they're wandering the wilderness for water and they find this pool of water that they can't drink from because it's bitter. And so what happens? Moses saves the people by tossing a tree into the pool. This strange little story is full of meaning when you see it in light of the bigger design pattern of trees in the Bible. We're going to explore all of this and even more on today's episode. So thanks for joining us. Here we go.",

We are still taking course questions that you all have about this series on the tree of life. We're going to do another question response episode during the series. So if you have a question about this theme of trees in the Bible or any of the stories that we have explored, we want to hear your questions. If you could record yourself asking the question, give us your name, where you're from, hopefully keep it to about 20 seconds or so and email it to us@infoibleproject.com Next week we're going to continue in this series by looking at some stories about trees and the life of David and in the book of Isaiah.",
