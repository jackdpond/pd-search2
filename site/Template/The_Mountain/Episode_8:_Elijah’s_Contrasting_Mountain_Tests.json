    "text": "Welcome to BibleProject podcast. We're continuing to trace the theme of the mountain through the story of the Bible. We've seen that mountains are an overlapping space of heaven and earth where humans are asked to ascend. And when they do, they face a crisis. Will they surrender everything and trust in God's wisdom in order to gain what is truly life? Or will they cling to their own wisdom? In today's episode, we talk about the story of Elijah. He's a prophet during the time of King Ahaz, whose wife is Jezebel. During Elijah's time, Israel has turned their allegiance to the God baal. And so Elijah calls a drought on the land, and then he takes the people of Israel up on Mount Carmel to force them into a decision. Who will they trust? The true God of all creation or this domesticated God of their own making?",

  {
    "text": "Humans belong on the land, but it's a part of the land that's elevated so high up towards the skies that the highest places of those peaks that we call mountains, they are described in the Bible as an in between kind of space. Often spaces where people encounter heaven on Earth, the main mountain at the center of the show. There's two in the Hebrew Bible, Mount Sinai, down in the deserts, and then Mount Zion, like the hill of Jerusalem. So these are places where heaven meets earth. So that's kind of the basic premise of mountains in the Bible, and the biblical authors take that for granted. What the biblical authors do is they place key pivotal moments of the larger biblical story consistently take place on mountains. And this is kind of the unique biblical take on the cosmic mountain motif is that it's a place where humanity comes to terms with the presence of God and the ultimate reality of human nature and purpose and existence. It's on the garden Mountain where humans are commissioned to rule as God's image and to spread God's order and generosity and goodness out into the land as God's partners. But humans, you know, really don't trust God and act in really terrible ways as a result towards each other. But God wants to get people back up the mountain. And so isn't it interesting that in the stories of Abraham, a key covenant partner of God's, his whole journey of trusting God, failing and having to reckon with it all takes place on a journey between two mountains, the mountains connected to the tree of moreh in Genesis 12, and then the mountain of Moriah that also has a tree on it. In Genesis 22, the story of Mount Sinai, Israel is going to face a test of whether they'll trust God. As God's covenant partners, they blow that opportunity. And because of what happens with the golden calf, Moses ascends the mountain and. And puts himself in the vulnerable place before God even surrenders his life and identifies with these covenant violators of Israel down below. We looked at the story of David and of how David brought the ark of God's mountain presence up to Jerusalem, and he blows it himself with Bathsheba. And then all the cascades out of that. And then the story of Samuel, the Samuel scroll, ends with David, David facing a test on that same mountain that is also called the mountain of Moriah, where Abraham had his test, where he both blows it through, a terrible choice that affects the people. But then in the last moment, he Inserts himself and like Moses, surrenders his life for his own sins on the mountain. And that's the place where the temple gets built, and that's the place where David's son is going to face his testimony. And at first he responds, well, he asks God to give him wisdom, but then he uses that wisdom to produce too much tov and it corrupts, distorts his sense of right and wrong. So I'm interested in what the biblical authors want to highlight, is that mountains are this place where the crisis, being on the mountain, forces you into a crisis of reckoning with who you are, what you define as good, what you think is life. And mountains are typically places where God forces people to surrender whether they think is life and the life they've created by their own wisdom, and to surrender it only to discover that God wants to give them an even deeper, richer life and vocation. But it requires a kind of death, a death on the passageway up the mountain. And I think that's the motif that so fascinates me. And it's the motif that the biblical authors keep putting in front of us when it comes to these mountains.",

    "text": "Yep, that's right. Yeah. And so that process of giving up something that I thought was life but actually might prevent me from really experiencing the abundant life of God's gift on the mountain. It feels like a death to give that thing up. Even if I get it back again, I don't know that I'm going to get it back again. What I know is that I need to give it up. And that's what's happening with Isaac, that's what's happening with David, and that's what's happening with Solomon, too. I don't know how to lead these people. Solomon says. So he puts himself in a vulnerable place before God to say, I don't know what to do. And then that release of control he finds, at least for a time, when he trusts God, he gets an abundant version of life that he had never even imagined. That's a major theme of these mountain stories, is somebody giving up or not giving up the thing that is most precious to them. What's interesting about the story of Elijah is that two stories with opposite lessons are placed right next to each other. A success story, and then a major fail story.

And that's a crisis for anybody who worships baal. If there's no rain, anybody, then Baals must be ticked off at you. We're not in right relationship with BAAL if there's no rain. So the drama is about how God provides food and water for his prophet in the midst of this drought. And we don't have time to go through 1 Kings 17, though. It's amazing. What I want to focus on is chapter 18. Chapter 18 begins in many days later. The word of Yahweh came to Elijah in the third year. So sequences of three are almost always associated with the test. There's going to be some test of someone's trust. In the story, God said, go present yourself to Ahab so that I can give rain on the face of the land. So Yahweh is showing his role as creator by withholding rain, and now he's showing his role as creator by giving rain. So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab, and the famine was very severe in Samaria, which became the capital city of the north. So when Ahab and Elijah meet, Ahab saw Elijah and said to him, is that you? You who have thrown Israel into confusion? This whole drought's your fault. Like, this is your fault. Elijah responds, no, no, no, I didn't throw Israel into confusion. You and the house of your Father have by forsaking the commands of Yahweh and following after baal.

And multiple times the narrator just says, there was no voice, there was no response. There was no answer to their prayers or to their cry. He jokes, perhaps Baal's on a journey, he's on a work trip. Maybe he's asleep and needs to wake up. Yeah, I get sassy. But there was no voice, no response, no answer. Elijah said, everybody, all the people come near to me. Then he rebuilds a Yahweh altar right there on top of the mountain. He rebuilds it from 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of Jacob. Now that's interesting because the tribes are split right now he has a vision of all Israel reunited on the mountain, experiencing the presence of God. This is also what Moses did when the covenant with Yahweh was made on Mount Sinai. He built a 12 stone altar. So this big hyperlink. He's like a new Moses. Then he built the altar. Then he arranged the wood and had the bowl cut into pieces. And then he ups the ante. This famous. He says, get four jars, fill them with water. And this is during the famine, during the drought.

And the test is for the 12 tribes of Israel. Anyway, it's great number symbolism. And then he prays. He says, yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel. That goes back to the ancestors. Let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and that I have done all these things by your word. Answer me, Yahweh. Answer me so this people will know that you, o Yahweh, are God and that you have turned their hearts back again. Then the fire of Yahweh fell down and it ate up the burnt offering, it ate up the wood, it ate up the stones, it ate up the dust, and it ate up the water that was in the trench. It licked it all up.
