Today's Monday, March 15, 2020 and the world is figuring out how to deal with the novel coronavirus called COVID 19 and I'm sure this is affecting your life in some way. The west coast of the United States where we are located, have banned gatherings of 250 people or more, amongst other precautions. And Tim and I, we were talking about this. We have both worked on church staff in the past and we know how impacting a church cancellation is on the local church. There's a direct connection to the people attending on a Sunday and how much the church receives in gifts that week. And so we want to encourage you, if you're part of a local church that can't gather, to consider making an extra effort to continue to give to your church during this time. Also, if you're on our email list this week, you're going to get some ideas on how you can use some Bible Project resources do during smaller informal gatherings that may be an alternative to the large weekly gatherings that are being canceled. If you aren't on our email list, you can get on it. Go to Bibleproject.com, scroll to the very bottom of the page and you'll see a place to sign up for our newsletter. Above all, this is a time for us as followers of Jesus to remember. We have a hope that transcends all of this and it's an opportunity to practice his vision of generosity and self giving love to others. Okay, now onto the episode hey, this is John at the bibleproject and today we're kicking off a new series on how to read the parables of Jesus. Even if you've never read the Bible, odds are you've heard one of Jesus parables. A couple famous ones are the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son. These parables have stuck in our culture because they're memorable. But why did Jesus tell parables? One reason was he wanted to introduce us to the way he views the world.",

    "text": "So they're not primarily just moralistic tales telling you what could be a good person, but they do often address ethical values. But what was his announcement of the kingdom of God except that this is life in a whole new upside down ethical value set? Parables that we often think are about morals are actually usually about the new value system of the kingdom of God.",

Because as Moshe, our parable, little figure in our parable, as he goes back to town more and he hears Jesus more and more, he also begins to observe Jesus behavior, his signs, and wonders how he invites all these really suspect people to eat meals together.

The parables were a way that Jesus offered commentary on the rest of the kingdom of God package that he was bringing about. And he writes scholar N.T. wright. It's become well known to me because he's written and said it in multiple contexts, but that the parables were prompted by Jesus need to explain what he was saying and doing with the rest of his mission. In other words, what Jesus was saying and doing prompted questions. And the parables are a response to address those questions. Why does this man eat with sinners and tax collectors? Why does he heal on the Sabbath? Why does he spend so much time with undesirable people? And the parables are necessary as these explainers, but what they do is invite the person to investigate more.

Their focal point, often the topic and theme of almost all of them is the arrival of God's kingdom. And this is different than how when I start following Jesus and reading the Bible. When I started attending church in my 20s and hearing people teach on the parables, I remembered the way I would hear them taught, at least in church settings, was often either that they were teaching you to do something, to act in a certain way, moral lessons, a moral lesson, or as a kind of theology essay in symbols or allegory.
