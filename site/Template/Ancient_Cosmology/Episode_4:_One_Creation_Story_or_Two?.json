We saw the ideas and images that all of these creation stories had in common. And with that in mind, we looked at Genesis chapter one, verses one and two. And we saw how the creation story in Genesis is, is in debate with these other ancient cosmologies. God does not emerge from the chaos, nor does God need to battle the chaos. The God of the Bible hovers over the dark abyss, using it as a canvas to bring life and order simply with his word. In this next part of the conversation, we're going to look at the second creation story in Genesis.",

They're talked about as t home. And in Genesis 1, verse 2, it's when darkness is over the waters, the realm of darkness and nothingness is over the waters. They're tahome. Yeah, but then the next line says, but the spirit of God is on the face of the waters. And then they're called by a different Hebrew word, hamayim, which is the word used to describe waters in their neutral or positive life giving context. Rivers and streams and irrigation canals, that kind of thing. Water can have two different results, have two different meanings depending on who's over the face of them. Darkness versus the Spirit of God. The rest of Genesis 1 is going to be about how the breath of God, when God speaks, his breath goes.",

He wrote one, the most thrilling biblical theology of Leviticus that you'll ever read. But he's got a lot of great stuff on topic here. It's called who can ascend the mountain of the Lord? And then he's got a more technical academic study called the Tabernacle, prefigured how Genesis 1 and 2 presents the world and then the garden of Eden as the archetypal tabernacle. So we'll talk about them more in a later series. He was the first one who put it this way to capture my attention. He says essentially, how is it that you get from the dark waters of tuom to Genesis 2 with the river springing up out of Eden, giving life to the garden and then spreading out to give life to the rest of the world.

So you get this concept of the land coming out of the waters. That's day three of Genesis. And in the conception in Genesis one and throughout the Bible, the land is conceived of as a floating, gigantic floating disk, a bounded disc that's bounded by the seas. I mean the concept sea to sea. In our minds we think of a continent. In these authors minds they thought of, the cosmos is bounded from sea to sea. And it's floating on those dark waters that are beneath or held up by pillars. Well, the reason it doesn't sink is because of the pillars God put there. Yeah, that's right. So here I pointed out some of these passages. The opening lines of Psalm 24, the land is Yahweh's and all it contains the world and all who dwell in it, for he has founded it.

And when it's rain, he's just letting a little bit out to give you life. And when it's the spring, he's letting a little bit out to give life. So this is the conception, land founded on the seas.

So for scholars who think this whole thing is we're supposed to be thinking Mesopotamia, then what they do is find ways to match the Gihon and the Pishon to things going on in Mesopotamia. That's been one approach. A guy named Ephraim Spizer wrote a really significant work just nerding out on the four rivers. In the modern era, there have been people who hold to maybe a young earth position. And so for them this is a preservation of like pre flood geography, which of course would be all different now. And so it's preserving a geography that it doesn't exist anymore. That would be another approach. I think another approach is that this is like almost all geography in the Bible, a form of theological geography, meaning that just like when you're reading in biblical poetry and Isaiah says that Jerusalem will be elevated as the tallest mountain in all of the earth, what he's describing is its theological significance among the nations, not that there's going to be an earthquake and extreme uplift and so on. We did a whole video on settings in the Bible. Places are charged with theological meaning based on what has happened there or what is going to happen in a place. And so lo and behold, isn't it interesting that the Pishon is connected with Egypt and the Tigris and Euphrates are connected with Babylon.

I think One of those rivers ran right through there. A little respite of Eden meets her. And who does she meet there? She meets Yahweh, the angel of the Lord. Yeah, totally. And so this becomes this place where Yahweh acknowledges, like, yeah, this is screwed up, but go back, submit yourself to your oppressor, and let me tell you. And then he gives her the blessing of Eden. I will multiply your seed so there'll be too many to count, and so on. So she inherits this Eden blessing by an Eden fed spring, way out in the middle of the wilderness. This is what I mean. These are little narrative hints, but they keep happening. So then all of a sudden, springs and wells. This one is connected to the one in Eden. But then just springs and wells in general become places where life and blessing and fertility happen.

And then after that, we're gonna do a question and response. If you'd like to submit a question, we'd love to hear from you. Record yourself asking your question. Keep it to about 20 or 30 seconds. Let us know your name and where you're from, and then email it to infoibleproject.com and please, it would be really helpful if you also transcribed your question in your email. It saves us a lot of time. Today's show was Produced by Zach McKinlay and Dan Gummel. The show notes are done by Lindsey Ponder and our theme music from the band Tense. Bibleproject is a nonprofit, and our mission is to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus. All of this taming of darkness, it comes to its fulfillment in the life of Jesus. We're not going to make a video about ancient cosmology but we do have lots of videos on other topics and you can watch those all for free. There's study notes, there's seminary level classes, and all of it is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you. So thank you for being a part of this with us.",

My youth pastors just kept on showing these really awesome videos. I mean, they were just so beautifully put together with these really deep themes. And most of the time they were answering questions that I had to the Bible that if any of the kids had asked me, I would have known what to say. So I eventually just asked like, hey, what are these people videos and where are they coming from? And they directed me towards the YouTube channel for Bibleproject immediately. I can tell you that I binge watched as many videos as I could that very night and kind of the rest is history. Three years later. I pretty much use the Bible Project every single day. Whether it's the Read Scripture videos, How to Read the Bible series, the podcasts that come out each week, pretty much every time I open the Bible. Bibleproject is not that far behind. My favorite thing about the Bible Project is just the level of accessibility that you guys give for people like me that maybe haven't received super deep training, but just in a way that's really super easy to understand. We can see just how the Bible works together in each book and all the context and nuances and just really accessible way. We believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus or a crowdfunded project by people like me. Find free videos, study notes, podcasts, classes, and more@bibleproject.com thanks, guys.",
