He says water is commonly conceived in the Bible and ancient Near Eastern literature as a symbol of the oppositional forces of life, an ambiguous symbol of life and death. Water is symbolic of death when it's uncontrolled, whether you have too much or in a flood or too little, as in a drought. But it's also a symbol of life. When it's controlled, it provides growth and fertility. So the waters are a perfect symbol of life or death, of order and of disorder. This summarizes the movement from Genesis 1:2, where the waters are dark and abysmal to the waters of Eden in Chapter two, which describes the river coming up out of the land. The land sits on top of the waters.",
