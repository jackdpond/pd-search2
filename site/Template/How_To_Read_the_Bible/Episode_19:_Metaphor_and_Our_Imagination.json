It's sturdy. I've held a rock in my hand. I've had the experience of trying to move a large rock across a field. I've stood on a tall pillar and felt its strength below me. Now I have this other experience that's a lot more abstract. And my abstract experience is feeling that God is ultimately dependable. Map these two experiences onto each other and you get the metaphor. God is my rock. And while most biblical metaphors are easy enough to understand, like that one, we have to remember that every culture develops its own various types of metaphors that will seem strange to another culture. And this is true for those who wrote the Bible. A great example of this is how biblical authors constantly use the image of tumultuous waters to describe any experience of danger, whether it be the unknown, dangerous people, dangerous situations, and even enemy nations.",
