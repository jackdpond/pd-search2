You are seriously, on the count of two hands, moments where you're given the inner thoughts of a character for why they're doing something. And so the art of reticence, biblical narrative uses characters as a vehicle primarily through showing what they do and what they say, rather than telling you about them or telling you why they do what they do. So showing rather than telling is the shorthand for that.",

So God called Abraham to leave his family and go to this new land. And then the last. And so Abraham left his family and he went to the land and Lot went with him. And you're like, what? Wait, no, that. That wasn't the plan. Like, he wasn't supposed to do that. Why did Lot go with him? And then you're just left with this gap in this strange detail. You're never given Abraham's inner psychology of why he did what he did. You're just. You are shown his choice. And then as a narrative technique, it's a way of. You're showing a choice of a character. But the reader has to work for an interpretation. And this is typical all the way through Genesis 22, God tests Abraham. Take your son, your only son, and give him as an offering, you know, on the place, I'll show you. And the reader, you're scandalized. You're like, why is God doing this? Why is God saying this? And what's going on inside Abraham's mind? And you're never once given psychology. You're just given, he wakes up early in the morning, he packs his bags, and then, you know, Isaac speaks up, dad, where's the. We have the wood, we have the fire. Where's the ram for the offering?

We have to adjust our habits from constantly being given the inner dialogue of characters and learn how the biblical narratives force you to work. They're engaging you in a wrestling match by this. Just think through all these stories of the Bible, and all of a sudden you'll start asking, oh, why did he do that? You know, why did God accept Abel's offering but not Cain's? And, oh, was Cain jealous? The story actually never says that. The story just says he got bummed. So almost every biblical story is capable ultimately of about three or four different interpretations in a way, at a first pass. Because you realize, oh, I'm not being given information. Half the information I wish I had to make sense of the story. And you think it's an error in the narrative, but in fact it's the intentional technique.",

    "text": "Yeah, we'll get there, we'll get there. But just it forces the reader to do a lot of things, forces them to work ultimately. It's a very powerful tool that biblical narratives use. It might help us just get into some examples and you can just kind of see it. So there's two ways that biblical authors can use characters. One is what's called direct characterization. So the narrator will actually describe the character for you or tell you about them. So this would be like physical appearance on a, you know, small list of people whose looks are described. And it's only ever because it's relevant. It will play a role in the plot. So Joseph is very handsome. Potiphar's wife is going to get after him. Lie with me, right? Saul is very tall. When you first meet him and you're like, okay, why is that important? And then you get into the story. David is short and David is short, but David's good looking. And Esau, he's red and hairy, he's covered with red hair, all these kinds of things. And the looks are only described functionally because they'll play a role in the story. Occasionally the narrator will just straight up tell you, yeah, this guy's bad. But it's very rare. It happens a lot like in the kings, the stories of the kings. This king was bad because of this. But for the most part, biblical narrators refrain from sermonizing or moralizing characters. What they do is just set their choices in front of you and then you have to be the one to evaluate. So one Jewish scholar, her name's Adele Berlin, she has a great, really great way of talking about this, about when the biblical authors do directly describe characters. It's very rare and it's always very strategic. And she compares it to impressionist painting. So again, similar to Rene Magritte about his contrast with realism and saying it's always representation. So he's a part of the surrealist movement, the impressionist movement. Was explicitly trying to draw attention to the fact that we can never describe things as they are. And so this was a movement that didn't try to achieve detail, but they did try to achieve the same effect that an image would have on you through minimal detail, through tiny strokes or pointillism was the same through tiny. Just thousands of tiny dots. So that when you get up close to the painting, it's like loses its meaning. There's hardly anything here. But then you back up and it's. The impression actually creates more. So, for example, by just telling you, esau is hairy. So what else is hairy? Animals are hairy, you know, and we're told he's an outdoorsman. And then he goes on in the story to behave like an animal, accumulating wives. He sees women and marries them on the spot in narrative time. You know, the whole thing is that he's hasty and he's hungry. Give me this food. And so he's actually. His hairiness creates an animal, primitive, man like impression about him. But it's just two words in Hebrew, right?",

    "text": "And all of a sudden, his whole Persona has this aura of animal likeness about him. Eli, the priest. Eli at the beginning of Samuel, he is old and blind, but then he is also morally blind to the horror of what his sons are doing. And he's old and feeble, like physically, but then he's feeble because he can't stand up to his sons. So his blindness and age and weakness actually become his character. And the same thing. You already brought this out, that Saul is really tall and David's short. And that actually describes the whole plot conflict of the Saul and David narratives, where Saul's this oppressor, but his height betrays the weakness of his character, the flaws in his character and David's short. But David's shortness and radical faith and humility is exactly what allows him to be exalted to this position of power. So Berlin's point here. Well, actually, here is a great quote from it here. She says, in impressionist art, the suggestion of a thing may be more convincing than a detailed portrayal. This is due to the tendency of our brains to project meaning onto images in order to complete our expectations. She's talking about impressionist art here, right? We see what we expect to see, and the surrounding information guides our perception. This is why we fill in a partially drawn figure to conform to our expectations. And in some cases, too much detail might destroy the image. So the trick, from the artist's point of view, is how much Detail to include and how much to omit. She applies this to reading biblical narrative. This is a good corrective for those who wish biblical stories provided more concrete details. But this is precisely its narrative technique. The gaps left in biblical narratives are intentional so that with a few deft strokes, the biblical author engages the imagination of the reader to construct a picture that's more real than if he had filled in David or Abraham or Joseph's portrait. With more detail, minimal representation can give maximal illusion. It's brilliant.",

And there's different snippets, quotes from these old Israelite epics, but for the most part, they've been converted into prose narrative, which is what we have before us 43% of the Hebrew Bible. So I think that's also too the evolution of or the development of the narrative technique developed from a condensed form into more prose narrative. But I think it's the same challenge we come across. Just think of any biblical story that's ever confused you, and I guarantee it's from some lack of detail that would unlock the whole thing for you.

But in reading the Bible, we're constantly puzzling over the gaps in the story. Why did Moses do that? Why did God do that? And this is strategic. Our puzzlement is an imitation of our real position in life. It exposes our ignorance about the meaning of history and our lives. Biblical stories imitate our real life conditions of inference, as we too are daily surrounded by ambiguities. We're baffled, we're misled by appearances. We're reduced to piecing fragments together by trial and error of interpretation. And we're often left in the dark about the meaning of our lives until the very end.",

It is only by sustained effort that the reader of biblical narratives can attain to the point of view that you come to realize only God possesses all along. Making sense of biblical stories is to gain a sense of. Of being human. So his first point is that this minimalist style is trying to recreate in the narrative your experience of your own life.

    "text": "And this is why, even though you think you know the story, because you read the Children's book of Noah or whatever, you can never replace sitting down and reading it slowly from beginning to end. There's just something about that experience of biblical narrative. You can't replace it with teaching it. You'll always have to clarify and make it simpler than it actually is. And so the literature itself forces you to do the only thing with it it's meant for, which is to sit down and read it from beginning to end. And you cannot replace that experience because that itself is a drama. And that's how the. That's how biblical literature is designed. It's brilliant. Anyhow, that's the first thing. And then the second thing is about how God's depicted. And this is kind of landing the plane. But so God's the only character who unites the whole Bible. He's the only character who's on page one and still around on the last page. And so there's a few things relevant, namely that that tells us something, that the purpose, ultimate purpose of these stories isn't even necessarily human centered, but that it's revealing something about God's relationship to the human story. God's character, God's identity and God's purposes for history. And those are all revealed in those same dramatic, ambiguous ways. Why did God do that? Why did he do the whole Exodus showdown the way that he did it? Why didn't he do it a different way? Why did he almost killed Moses in the middle of the night in Exodus 4, right before the all this? I mean, just, you know, God's a complex character totally in the biblical narrative. But then this was. Sheesh. There's another Israeli biblical scholar who pointed this out to me. And the moment she did, her name's Yaira, it was so clear and it helped make sense of many biblical stories. She calls it the dual depictions of God, God's dual roles in biblical stories. And she just says, pay attention. Stories where God is super involved, like God's talking to people, they're talking back to him. God does this and act. The Exodus story, correct? Yeah, the Exodus story, Genesis 1 through 11, Abraham stories. So these are stories where typically the human characters are less developed and they're more simplistic and their moral evaluation is more black and white. Either they listen or they don't listen. Either they obey or they disobey. Either they're blessed or they suffer consequences. But then there are other stories where God is depicted more as a behind the scenes character. And so where God doesn't say a lot, but he's just said to be with somebody. Like the Joseph story. God doesn't explicitly show up, dear Joseph, do this. But we're just told God's with Joseph a couple times. And then it's just random coincidences keep happening. And so she puts it this way. She says, this is Yaira Amit from her book Reading Biblical Narratives. She says the more God is depicted as a present character, commanding or testing, punishing or forgiving, the more the human characters are depicted in a flat manner. Singular types like rebellious, obedient or sinful. But when God is portrayed as more absent or behind the scenes, there's more narrative space for multifaceted human characters and the complexity of their motives. So the Joseph story, the David story, Esther.",

    "text": "Yeah. Ezra, Nehemiah. These are whole books where God doesn't show up a ton and interact just like one of the other characters. It's more occasional mention behind the scenes. And then those are the scenes where these really complex characters come to the surface that force you to work a whole lot, this kind of work. So that's an interesting dynamic too, that God's relationship, the way God's portrayed in a story, the more he's involved, the more morally clear that narrative is. The more he's behind the scenes, the more it imitates our real life day to day experience, which is like, where is God involved today? Yeah, sometimes I wonder, sometimes I feel really confident. Those days seem more clear to me. But then other days I feel like I don't know and I question my motives, I question other people's motives. So it's another one of these ways that the biblical stories imitate our just day to day life experience in the journey of faith. It's brilliant. This is Matthew from Portland, Oregon. We believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus.",
