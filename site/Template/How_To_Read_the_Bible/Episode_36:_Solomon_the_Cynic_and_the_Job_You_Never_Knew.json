    "text": "Hey, this is Tim at the Bible Project. And today on the podcast, we are going to finish our series on how to read the wisdom literature in the Bible. If you've been tracking with our conversation so far, you'll know that we've been covering these books in the Bible that are associated with Solomon. We began his story actually way before him, back in the Garden of Eden, with the failed human quest for wisdom that resulted in humanity's exile. And so Solomon comes as a new Adam figure who gets things right, who trusts God to give him wisdom, at least for a little while, until he replays the failure of Adam and Eve. And so this is the context for the wisdom books, the books of Solomon in the Bible. In the previous episodes, we've looked at Proverbs and the Song of Songs. And today we're going to look at two books connected to the wisdom literature, the Book of Ecclesiastes and the Book of Job. Ecclesiastes is kind of like the cold, wet blanket thrown on you in the Hebrew Bible. You read it and it's either depressing or I like to think of it as just a heavy dose of realism. This book is unique and different in that Solomon isn't actually named, but the figure that we meet speaking in the book is a Solomon like person. And John and I explore what that means and the fascinating implications. And this Solomon figure has eaten some humble pie in his life. In Solomon's story, it's because he didn't truly live by God's wisdom. He failed royally, pun intended. And he didn't rule wisely, as God called him to. And so it's as if in Ecclesiastes we hear the voice of this failed elder Solomon looking back over his life of hardship, and he's trying to warn the next generation of the things that he has learned the hard way, so that perhaps you don't have to. After that, John and I are going to talk about the Book of Job yet again. I learned a whole bunch of new stuff recently about the Book of Job. And so we're going to process that in this conversation. The character of Job is presented as someone who is upright. He fears God, he does the right thing. He's the ideal wisdom figure that Solomon and Adam and Eve and Abraham, all of these people in the Hebrew Bible, he is what none of them were, a truly righteous, wise person who fears God, and yet he suffers unfairly. God even says so. So what is up with that? The Book of Job is actually staring that paradox or contradiction of faith right in the Face. The last chapter of the book has a number of puzzles that unlocked for me recently and reading some work of some other scholars. And so I'm excited to share that with you because the role of Job in the Hebrew Bible just leaped off the page and how it connects to the New Testament and the story of Jesus in some really profound and exciting ways. So all that and more in this conversation on Ecclesiastes and Job. Thanks for joining us, you guys. Here we go.",

So that list in Ecclesiastes 2, 4, 10, he says, I made great. I made my works great. I built houses for myself, planted vineyards for myself. I made gardens and parks. I planted fruit trees. You see Genesis 3 leaping off the page here. I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees, male and female slaves, homeborn slaves, flocks, herds more abundant than all before me in Jerusalem. I collected silver and gold and the treasure of kings. I provided for myself, male and female singers and the pleasures of men, many concubines.

So this is part of her larger argument to say the Solomon like voice is actually drawing upon the narratives about all of the sons of David, not just Solomon, because the Hezekiah story is very similar. He has a great start, builds Eden, rescues the city from Assyria, and then the last story about him is how he blows it with these emissaries from Babylon and sinks the whole ship. Again, a quote from Jenny Barber about this. She says, in all of these ways, the building projects, the riches, the treasuries, the pools and the singers, the royal boast in Ecclesiastes chapter 2 displays a king's achievements in terms that show how an author of the Second Temple period is reading and interpreting the stories of Israel's kings. In other words, what she's saying, this is her view on the authorship of the book. You can disagree with her, that's fine, but it's an interesting perspective. And any view of the authorship of the book has to account for why Solomon isn't named and why the Persona and the voice is hyperlinking to stories of all of the kings, not just Solomon. So her way of saying is this is a really late biblical author who's created a voice and Persona, speaking as if it's the whole line of David, the sad line of David sitting in exile. So she goes on, she says the writer has pulled together texts and motifs from Israel's histories to show that the paradigm King Solomon set the mold that was continually replicated through the rest of Israel's monarchy, right down to the exile. She shows how in Jewish interpretive tradition, ancient Jewish readers sometimes these connections. And so they portrayed Solomon as actually foreseeing the whole history of his line crashing and burning in exile as the context for the book of Ecclesiastes.",

So job is blameless and upright. He turns away from Ra. Adam was placed in the garden with a clean slate, and he sinned by taking of the Tree of Knowing. Good. And Ra. Yeah. Job's children would have these parties and get together and feast. And when the feast was over, he would clean up afterwards, consecrate his children by making sin offerings. By making offerings for them. But he would consecrate them, set them apart. And lo and behold, in the Eden narrative, God is consecrating the land, or, excuse me, consecrating the seventh day. So Job consecrates the homes of his seven sons. God consecrates the seventh day. It's just echoes.",

And then once they realized it, by taking from the fruit, from dust, you were taken to dust, you will return. In other words, the nakedness. And then from dust back to dust, to dust I return. Job is echoing those lines from the Eden story, when he says, naked I came from the womb of my mother, naked in the garden story of Eden, God provides Eve. And Adam says, this is bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh. But then the one that God provides, bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, becomes the deceived deceiver in the story. In the same way, in the Job story, the Satan asked to strike his bone and his flesh, and surely he will curse you to your face. That's what the Satan says to God. And then Job doesn't curse God, but his wife comes and says, curse God and die. And he says, you're speaking like a temptress, like a foolish woman. So the whole point is all these corresponding Eden stuff. So Sam Meyer says, the correspondence between the behavior of Job's wife and Adam's wife, it's Eve's instigation that Adam disobeys God. The serpent stands in the relationship to Eve that the Satan does to Job's wife. It's all this. So we're watching another version of the temptation of Adam happen. But Job passes the test.",

You know, lousy comforters all you want. This is fascinating. It is true that this prayer of Job is the first selfless act that he's performed since his misfortunes overtook him. Not that we begrudge him the self centeredness that's dominated his speech throughout the book. Perhaps his renewed orientation to the needs of others is the first sign that he's abandoned his inward looking mourning and is ready to accept consolation. In any case, the very act of offering his prayer on the friend's behalf is when his own restoration is said to take effect. The Hebrew says Yahweh restored the fortunes of Job while he was praying for his friends. Not, as most versions have it, when or after he prayed for his friends. Mind blowing. At least for me.

We would love to hear from you. Here's how you can do it. You can email a question to us@infoointhebibleproject.com if you could make an audio recording, give us your name, where you're from, that would be awesome. And if you can, please try to keep the question to about 20 or 30 seconds. All these conversations that John and I had on the wisdom books of the Bible were in preparation for a video that we made so through the Bible Project and it's now out. It's a video called how to Read the Books of Solomon. You can check it out on our website, thebibleproject.com or go to YouTube.com thebibleproject Today's show was produced by the amazing Dan Gummel. Theme music was by the band Tense.
