    "text": "Welcome to the BibleProject podcast. Last year, Tim and I were in Milpitas, California, for a conference called Regeneration. And while we were down there, we did a live recording of this podcast with a couple hundred leaders from around that area. And today we're going to release the first part of that live recording. It was a ton of fun being down there with Tim. And if you've never been in a room with Tim while he geeks out about the Bible, well, you're in for a treat. Tim just gets excited. And no other topic lights Tim up. Like the topic we addressed that day, the topic at hand is what we've come to call design patterns in the Bible. If you've been following this project, you know that we like to talk about how the Bible is literary genius. And one of the things that makes the literature of the Bible so sophisticated is how every story in the Bible seems to be aware and riffing off of every other story in the Bible, no matter what author, no matter what time period. It all connects together with this amazing awareness of how stories are told, why they're told that way, and the patterns that emerge become immensely important for us to understand what the authors were trying to communicate. To us, this might seem really geeky, maybe not that useful, maybe just sounds really strange. Well, hang in there. We're going to break down what it is, and we'll follow a few design patterns through Scripture. And as we do, I guarantee you're going to see how rich, insightful, and profound the literature in the Bible is. So thanks for joining us. Here we go.",

And so then John pitched the idea of, let's just have it with a group of people. And then because he's always prodding me with questions, and so let's just let a whole group of people contribute. And so this is actually part of our normal process where I put together a bunch of stuff, we talk for hours, then he goes and writes a summary. And that becomes the first draft of a script for a video. So a video will come out of this conversation. And there you go. Is that cool? Deal. Yeah. Cheers. Let's see.

    "text": "Yeah. So nearly half of the Bible is ancient Jewish narrative, both in the Hebrew Scriptures and in the New Testament, the Gospels and Acts are ancient Jewish style biblical narrative. And you know, they're at the same time some of the most beloved parts of the Bible. Because narratives are really a universal form of human communication. Who doesn't, you know, it's just easy. But every culture has its own unique way of telling narratives. And in the biblical tradition, these authors developed a really brilliant, truly brilliant set of tools for how they tell their stories. And they're really, really, really different than how modern Westerners create and perceive how stories work. So that was the goal of the video series. You might think four videos. Just read the narrative and it's like, okay, yeah, that's fine. But there's going to be all kinds of things I've discovered over the years, all kinds of really amazing layers of meaning to stories in the Bible that I just simply was unaware of or never saw before. Because until I've actually learned how to read them as Jewish narratives, Jewish literature, with a really particular set of conventions and attributes and ways that these stories work. So there you go.",
    "start": "00:05:32",
    "end": "00:07:07"
  },
  {
    "text": "So big picture biblical narrative, there's plot, setting, character. And let me try to give summarize what the main takeaways for each of those were really quickly.",
    "start": "00:07:08",
    "end": "00:07:21"

    "text": "Deal.",
    "start": "00:07:21",
    "end": "00:07:21"
  },
  {
    "text": "And then you can correct me. Okay, so plot, biblical plot. That video is out. And I think the biggest takeaway for me is that a biblical plot is like any plot. We're familiar with plots, we watch movies, we read books, and so there's a character and they're setting. There's this call to adventure, there's all this rising tension that leads up to a conflict which ultimately has a resolution and then the characters change and comes to a new normal, a new world. And biblical stories have these same plot structures. And so we looked at, in the video, we looked at Gideon and how if you don't see the overall plot and understand a story in that context, you could easily have it say something the author didn't intend. So we looked at Gideon and the fleece and we saw how Gideon was asking God for a sign and he put a fleece on the ground, make the fleece dry and the ground wet, and God does it. And you read that story and you're like, oh my goodness, that's a great story on how to discern God's will. But then you read the story in context of the whole biblical plot and you realize that it's just one part of this whole rising plot tension of Gideon not trusting God. So that's a big takeaway. But I think the bigger takeaway with plot, which the video didn't have a lot of time to explain, but the podcast goes in a lot of detail, if you've listened to our episode on plot, is that there's, like, embedded plots in the Bible. So you have this story of Gideon which takes place in. And a whole series of stories that make up the Book of Kings. And that entire. I'm sorry, Judges. And that entire set of stories has its own plot structure, which then. And you call those. What?",

    "start": "00:09:25",
    "end": "00:09:32"
  },
  {
    "text": "And then those all fit into a. A grand biblical plot from creation to new creation. And so seeing how these plots are embedded, it's like at any given moment, reading the Bible, you're like in Inception, right? You're like a plot within a plot within a plot.",
    "start": "00:09:33",
    "end": "00:09:51"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yes. Well, that's good illustration. I don't think you brought that up before. That's a really. That's a good analogy.",
    "start": "00:09:51",
    "end": "00:09:59"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah, that's.",
    "start": "00:09:59",
    "end": "00:10:00"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yes. And actually, each time. Yeah, each time. Subplot you're in, you actually. It's easy to forget the governing plot. Like, why are they in this little sub world? Because of something. A plot conflict caused up here that forced them to go down and do this other one. Yeah, it's actually a really good analogy. Yeah.",
    "start": "00:10:00",
    "end": "00:10:18"
  },
  {
    "text": "So that's plot. And then we looked at. And then a video that's not out yet. It's almost out, actually. I don't know if it's almost out.",
    "start": "00:10:19",
    "end": "00:10:26"
  },
  {
    "text": "It's almost out. Sorry. So I think. Yeah, so for plot, it's that to conceive of the Bible, it's an epic narrative, which means it's a sprawling narrative, huge cast of characters. It's like, you know, like many epic narratives that are out there in the world. For modern Westerners, the most familiar ones now are Tolkien's, JRR Tolkien's world, the Lord of the Rings. Epic narratives. Right. Because even there's separate story worlds. There's the Ring trilogy, but then there's the Hobbit, which is its own, totally own plot, but it is related as, like, the pre plot that makes sense of the others. And that's totally how the Bible works. And so it's difficult when you're in the thick of the Book of Kings, you know, and you're looking at Jehoahaz and his wife Athaliah, and you're like, what does this have to do with anything? Like why do I care about this? And so I have to rise above and be like family of Abraham, God's blessing to all of the nations through these people. So it's another illustration I've used is of the Russian nesting dolls of dolls within dolls within dolls. And the whole point is to see them as a set. It's not just that you have one of them and then just sit them on whatever your dresser. It's to display them as a set, because that's how they make sense, is as a collection. And so learning how to keep track of the layers of plot and each layer will give a new context and new layers of meaning to events happening down here at the ground level. And if you begin to see how these authors have designed little mini episodes within their larger arcs, you begin to see bigger patterns, which is what we're going to talk about today. But learning to track plots and subplots, it's like one of the bread and butter things about learning to read biblical narrative. Well, nice.",
    "start": "00:10:26",
    "end": "00:12:21"
  },
  {
    "text": "Another basic element of narrative is characters. And so a character is the person experiencing the plot, going through the plot. And biblical narrative is full of characters. How would you summarize the big takeaway from that?",
    "start": "00:12:23",
    "end": "00:12:41"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah, well, I think so. At least in the history of Christian reading, especially of the Hebrew scriptures, we've had a hard time knowing what to do with these Bible characters. Some of them are very relatable, and we sympathize with their struggles, like an Abraham or a David or a Joseph or a Ruth. But. But then other characters and the way they figure into God's plans are really problematic for us, like a Samson or a Jacob. And I think somehow, especially in the Western Christian tradition, we tend to view the Bible as some kind of moral instruction book. And so the characters in the Bible are obviously there to be examples for us. The problem is that they're all mostly really immoral people, like, really screwed up people. And that's thrown Western readers for such a loop that look at our children's literature about the Bible. It's often hard to recognize the actual Biblical story in the children's versions that you tell that our kids are raised on. I have a version of the story of Jonah in a children's book at home. I don't read it to my kids, but just reminds me of an example of what's so screwed up about how we read the Bible. It doesn't even have the last chapter of the Book of Jonah where he's stewing outside the city, bummed that his enemies didn't get roasted by fire from heaven. Because if you end the story with Jonah obeying and going to Nineveh and the Ninevites repenting, that's a great story. And it teaches you. Obey God, Right? It's a very clear story. But the whole thing is about that last chapter, which turns the entire story upside down. And all of a sudden everything means the opposite of what you thought it meant. It's absolutely brilliant. And apparently that's too sophisticated for children. In a way, it is, because this is not children's literature. This is extremely sophisticated literature. And so what tends to happen is that biblical characters are presented to people who grew up in the church in these rewritten versions of biblical stories, so that when they actually come to read the Bible itself, the way these characters actually behave in the real stories is scandalous to us. We don't understand it. Why does God bless people who lie and murder? And why does the Holy Spirit come on Samson when he's, you know, a violent sex addict? And like, what? So is he an example? Am I supposed to be like him? Well, I guess not. I'm not going to kill people with the jawbone. So are you guys with me? So what are these people here for in the stories? And so that's. We're going to make a whole video about that because we are supposed to relate to them, but they are not put there as moral examples for us. They're more put there as mirrors for us to see ourselves and to see our own flaws and failures and successes. And how these characters relate to God began to give me a clue of what it means to relate to. To God in complex ways. There you go.",

And settings are easy to gloss over in any story and not appreciate how effective of a literary device it actually is. So if I'm telling you a story and it takes place in a haunted house, or no, sorry, just a spooky house.",

You're going to think, I know what's going to happen. I've been here before. And so the author can set your expectation really quick about what story is going to be about simply by the setting that the author puts it in. And so in the video, we're Going to talk about the setting of Egypt as a case study and how that setting becomes very important. But they're all over. And I was super surprised. Like, when we got into this, I realized, well, we could do a whole series of videos on settings and how they're used. From the wilderness being a setting, Jerusalem, Zion, all the. Yeah, Bethlehem, on and on and on. They become these very important places where certain things happen and the author wants you to remember those stories and they're building on that.

And that just is where that event happened. That event happened in Moab. That event happened in whatever, in Gilead or whatever. Gibeah. And so we don't think to come to these narratives with the expectation that the last story that happened in whatever, Gilead. But that may be like, four books ago. But the author knows, like, the author totally knows. And what you'll find is that key places keep getting repeated throughout the biblical narrative. And places acquire a symbolism based off the events that happened there. And you have to start from page one and they begin to build significance as you go through the story.

It's a little detail. They're banished to the East. And then after Cain and his murdering his brother, he's also banished in the very next story to the East. And then the culmination of all the rebellion stories in the book of Genesis is in the story of Babylon, where all the people had one speech and they moved to the East. And what happens in the East? The east is where you go when you've been estranged from God. The east is where you go as a consequence of your stupid decisions. And then with Babylon, where you end up is going to the east, where all humanity exalts itself up to the place of God. And then you just track with it as you go through the biblical narrative. Biblical authors, now that they've established the Drumbeat of East. They'll just throw it in there now and then they'll just throw. It's like a little seasoning, a little east seasoning in the story or something. And so they'll just throw in, like when David asked. When Absalom. When Absalom. The rebellion of Absalom comes in the story of David. And where does David flee from his own palace? He flees to the east. When all Israel rebels and has to go into exile, where do they go? They go to the east, to Babylon. They replay the Genesis 3 to 11 thing.",

But basically, from what I understand, is that all these things, the plots, the settings, the characters, they all become elements in which the biblical authors use to build on each other, create patterns, and you use a word a lot. Hyperlink. That the author will hyperlink back to other stories and ideas and just expect you, the reader, to see what's going on. He's not gonna tell you, hey, just like Moses did this.

They're all Hebrew Bible nerd professors and so kind of all around the world. But we have been coordinating our research efforts and reading around this set of topics. And so there's four other friends, and we've just. It's like we've never read the Bible before. It feels so fresh to me right now, and I feel like I'm. It's. Well, here's. Well, there's two analogies. There's actually two analogies. One is one that starts the notes, but the other one is. Oh, I've used it before already, actually, with you. Is Yoda. Yeah, Yoda. It's the scene in Dagobah in the Empire Strikes Back, where Luke comes looking for Master Yoda. But what he finds is a silly green creature. And of course, that is the Master. But the Master is so wise that he won't impose his reputation on Luke. What he's going to do is let Luke come to realize that he's in the presence of the Master. And so truly, it becomes a story about reality. Is for Luke, what he expects to see. And what he expects to see is a silly green creature. Of course, this isn't the Master. And so he never sees the Master until he has this breakthrough moment, and he realizes all along he's been in the Presence. You with me? It's a classic. So that's how I feel about the Bible. And I think it's essentially the way our relationships to these scriptural texts grows over time, is realizing that we are in the presence of such brilliant minds, empowered by God's spirit to write and compose this literature in ways that I just never even imagined was possible. But once you can begin, once you expect to see certain things, all of a sudden, narratives that you thought you understood, like you had no clue. That's. At least.

Where you do find it is scholars who are familiar with the history of Jewish interpretation of the Bible. And of course, that makes sense. These were crafted by ancient Israelite minds steeped in this tradition and way of. Of writing these texts. And so it makes perfect sense that the Jewish, They've been reading the Bible 1,000 years longer than Christians have.

A Jewish scholar named Robert Alter, who wrote one of the most helpful, really profound introductions to biblical narrative. It's called the Art of Biblical Narrative. And he has a chapter where he lays out what we're going to talk about. But it's like tip of the iceberg. And he begins it with this really great analogy introduction. And then there's analogy. So he says, a coherent reading of any work of art, whatever the medium, requires some detailed awareness of the grid of conventions upon which and against which this particular work operates. Usually, these are elaborate sets of tacit agreements between the artist and the audience that create the enabling context in which complex communication of art occurs. He likes to write long sentences, though. Through our awareness of convention, we can recognize significant or simply pleasing patterns of repetition, symmetry, or contrast. We can detect subtle clues and cues as to the meaning of the work. We can spot what is innovative and what is traditional at each part of the artistic creation. One of the Chief difficulties modern readers have in perceiving the artistry in biblical narrative is precisely that we have lost most of the keys to the conventions out of which these texts were shaped. So that's a dense, nerdy way of putting it. Then he has a great illustration. Cool. It makes it crystal clear. But maybe if you don't get his point, how would you put into normal words?",

And oftentimes, especially in very simple jokes, the setup is one beat, second beat, and then something unexpected. Ha ha, ha ha. And so is that similar to like it's creating?

Simon son of Jonah, renamed by Jesus as Petros Peter. But this family, this Jewish name, Simon, you know, Simon bar Jonah. There you go. So Simon son of Jonah goes to Joppa, from which the mission to the Gentiles explodes. Come now. You know what I'm saying? Do you get it? So here's what's brilliant about that, is because we're crossing. That's Luke. That means Luke is tracking with what's going on with Joppa and Jonah, and he's intentionally introduced details into the story to. That's a perfect example. Yeah. Thank you. That's a great example.

Or do some people think that, okay, these details were back added, like, say, for the east example that you mentioned, where is this something where post exilic time, then it becomes something that is a detail that's kind of added to kind of tie it forward to where at the time they would have been putting together all the scriptures to. So I'm curious about the history and how people tend to see how that would have unfolded.",

  },
  {
    "text": "Yep. Oh, man. Yeah. That's an extremely complex conversation, mostly because we just have so little hard data about the timing of the final composition of the books of the Bible. So in other Words, we can date a whole bunch of stuff in terms of the events, but the composition of the books themselves gives every evidence of having been a really prolonged process with lots of spirit guided prophetic authors that were a part of the process. And a great example, the best example is the conclusion of the Pentateuch, which the last chapter of Deuteronomy is about the death of Moses. And then the last sentences of Deuteronomy are. And no one to this day knows where he was based on buried. And then the last sentence of the Torah is, you know, a prophet like Moses just has never arisen among our people. So the time, perspective, even of the composition of the Torah is explicitly at a far distance from the events of Moses himself. Which doesn't mean that Moses didn't play a role in writing the materials in actually says that quite a lot in multiple parts. So the best analogy that I've found, or at least the one I've used the most, is that these books are like family quilts, where we have quilt pieces or earlier even sections that were already a bunch of quilt pieces combined and they've been received and passed on, carefully studied and preserved. And at some point in the post exilic period, the whole quilt of the Hebrew scriptures gets put together. And a lot of times that meant just providing like stitching around pre existing works. But other times it involved some rearranging of older works and this kind of thing. And the best example you can see this is in the book of Chronicles. The Chronicles is itself a representation of, of the representation of Samuel and Kings. And what the chronicler has. This is what Bible nerds scholars call the author of Chronicles. They call him the chronicler. But you can see exactly where he's doing biblical theology. He's representing the story of David in light of the Torah and the prophets. And so he's constantly adding in little details or repeated phrases as hyperlinks to link the whole Hebrew Bible together. So there's an author. We can actually watch the chronicler at work making the book in comparison with his sources. So anyway, I'm sorry, you get me going. You get me going.",

But they're not just archivalists, archivists, archivalists. They also want to make very clear to the readers the meaning and significance of what these events have for God's purposes in history. These events, they both represent events, and they present them in a way that shows you how they fit into God's purposes for all of history. And the primary way they do that is through narrative patterning. And so one of the biggest ways this happens, for sure, is in characters names, like the symbolic names that people have. And, you know, whether or not the husbands that Ruth and Orpah married, their names, you know, Machlon and Kilion. But those Hebrew words mean done for and sicko. And because they come onto the stage for one sentence only, to die, the author brings them on to kill them off to create the tragedy, the whole story. So would you ever name your kid sicko, you know, or done for? And so I do think these authors are writing literature, and they think about history and how to represent that history in a different way than modern people do. We just have this hang up. And it's from a good motive. Right. That the events, the core events, really represent things that happened. And I think that they care about that, too. Otherwise they wouldn't be telling us these stories. But they also want us to understand the meaning of these stories. And I don't think the authors were as nervous as we were about airbrushing.",

There's no better way to bring people into the biblical story than to show its high literary aesthetic, because that's compelling. But you're right. There's a whole other layer of American culture that. That's like, why wouldn't you just say it the way it is? Why do you got to use a metaphor? You know, why do you have to write poetry? Why do you have. Right. So I think man in a local church setting. I think it is about trying to find creative ways to imitate the literary diversity and beauty which the medium of the sermon can invite people into that, but it's certainly not the only or most effective way to do that. And so whether that's having public readings of scripture or biblical poetry or interpretation of scripture through other mediums to help get people using a different part of their brain to process things that are real and true, because that's what the Bible's doing.

The first thing that is not good explicitly is something that God identifies within his world. And it's of a human alone. So it, and it's. Notice it's a repetition. And the Lord, yeah, he said it is not. It's not good. So God is both a provider of what is good and he's the knower of what is good and what is not good because he can discern what's not. Are you with me? So it's all, all these go together here. So God's the one with knowledge of good and evil. So God and, and the male and the female and so on.

If you were to be the ones knowing what is good and what is not good, you would be like God. Which introduces an irony into the narrative because of course they are the image of God. So, so but that's how he dupes them. And so all of a sudden, knowing what is good and what is not good, it becomes into the human's mind, like, oh, maybe that's something that God's holding out on me. Which creates an irony in the story because all that God's been providing is good. Like that's what he wants for the humans. But now the humans have this choice in front of them. And so the key line comes when the woman saw that the tree was good. Now just that phrase right there. Who's the only other character up to this point who has seen and truly identified good God? This is very obvious. So you have now the human who's putting themself in the position of God to See what is good? Do you see the. It's a contrast using the same phrase. It's the human acting in the role that God has put themselves in. And when God sees good, what results? More good. When the humans see something and be like, ooh, that's the good thing. What happens? It's the opposite. So that's a good example of. It's an identical phrase. God saw that it was good. The woman saw that it was good.

And so it's the classic baptism scene of the sky opens, the heavenly voice speaks, you are my son, the spirit, all that. So you walk away from that narrative. Who's Jesus? He's the beloved son of the Father. There it is. He's the Son of God. The very next story is not a story. The next literary thing is the genealogy that Luke provides. And he builds it in such a way that actually begins with Jesus and then works backward all the way back through the Hebrew scriptures. It's a little. It's a reverse genealogy all the way back through the Hebrew scriptures going back to the first human character who's called the Son of God, Adam.",

And the first thing that the Satan is testing Jesus with is trying to undermine and get Jesus to doubt his identity as gets repeated. If you really are God's son, then do this. After that, Jesus goes to the town of Nazareth and. And he's giving his sermon, his intro sermon. And the first thing Luke tells us that people ask is, whose son is this again? Wait a minute. Isn't this the kid who grew up in town here? So now it's people doubting Jesus. After that is a story where Jesus casts out a demon. And the first thing that the evil spirits is, you are the Son of God. So look at what he's done here. He's put five episodes right next to each other all in a row. They all culminate in this moment of Jesus identity being the Son of God. But notice in each of the stories, it's a different type of claim being made. So in the first it's the Father. In the second, it's Luke appealing to Jesus sonship as in continuity with the story of the Scriptures. In the third one, it's about Jesus identity as the Son being tested. In the fourth one, it's his identity being doubted. And then in the fifth one, it's his identity being acknowledged, but from a really surprising source, namely spiritual evil. So in a very. You see, it's creative. This is creative way of forcing the reader to look at Jesus identity from all these angles. And so it's Luke's way of trying to persuade you as to the identity of Jesus. But he does it by showing how the identity of Jesus is complex and contested. And it's something that you have to discover, just like all these different characters and people do. It's brilliant. It's a great way of. Because he could just write like the way Mark does at the beginning. This is the gospel about Jesus Christ, the son of God. Now we're moving forward. Let's move on.",

But also, when you see key words repeating, you're supposed to start noticing all kinds of other things happening in the story that begin to match up as you go through themes, repeated ideas. So the first time the people ask for a king, and that's kind of screwed up, and that's a whole complex thing. We can't talk about that right now. But the people asked for a king. God allows them to choose a king. And then here comes the story. We're introduced to Saul, the son of Kish. And the first thing we're told about him is he was a man. Choice and good that there was no man more good than him. From his shoulder up, he was taller than anyone else from among all the people. Now, I'm highlighting that detail because it's going to become. Once you finish the story, it makes you want to go back and reread it, and you realize, oh, I get it.

So everything comes forward to the moment in 1st Samuel 9 when Samuel sees Saul for the first time. And the Lord says, this is the man who will direct my people. Later. When then Samuel, after he anoints Saul he then presents him to all of the people, and he says, does everyone. Do you all see the one whom the Lord has chosen? There's no one like him among all the people. Now, what does that mean? What makes him unique among all of the people?",

Which is not insignificant for where the narrative is going. And in the book of Samuel, if you know what I'm saying. Tall people, tall soldiers in the book of Samuel. Come now. So in other words, Samuel's being depicted here as somebody who's impressed by Saul's height. Yeah, that's what he first noticed. And now that's what he's introducing him to the people. And he's supposed to be the one who sees as the prophet. But we're beginning to wonder, like, he's just impressed with Saul's height. So Saul goes on to then have all these narratives of failure, of how he doesn't obey God's word and so on. And so Samuel says, you, Saul, have rejected the word of the Lord, and so the Lord's rejected you as king. The next part of the story is the introduction of David. And we hear the Lord say to Samuel, I've rejected Saul as king over Israel. I will send you Jesse from Bethlehem because among his sons, God says, I have seen for my people a king. So in other words, the narrative has introduced the seer. And you're supposed to trust him. He's a prophet. Right. He will see accurately. Right. He. He's a leader of God's people. But then the story tells you what it is Samuel saw. Samuel saw that he was tall and powerful. And then what does that tall, powerful guy do? He totally fails. And now God comes onto the scene and says, okay, since you didn't see right in the right way, God says, let me show you who I see. So Jesse brings seven out ten of. Out of eight sons before Samuel. And then the narrative is great. It says, when Samuel saw Eliab, the firstborn of Jesse, he said, oh, surely the Lord's anointed is before me. And the Lord said to Samuel, don't focus on his appearance. This is a good example. In Hebrew, the word see is Ra'. Ah. In Hebrew, sight is mar E. It's the same three letters at the root of the word. So literally, it's don't focus on his sight or his seeability. So don't focus on what is seen. Name. What, what, what is it that Samuel saw? How tall this guy is now? He's not talking about Saul. Who's he talking about? Who's he talking about? Who is Samuel seeing? He's seeing Eliab. So Eliab becomes this. He becomes another.",
