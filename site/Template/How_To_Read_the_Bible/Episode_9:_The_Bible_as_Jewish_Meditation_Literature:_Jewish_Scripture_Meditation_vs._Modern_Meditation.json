Last week, we talked about the story of Cain and Abel that you find on page four of the Bible. It's a classic story that highlights the Hebrew narrative style. It's short, confusing, ambiguous, and form. For millennia, people have studied and meditated on it. This week, Tim and I continue our conversation on the Cain and Abel story, and we discuss why meditation literature encourages this type of wrestling.",

All right, verse eight. Now, Cain said to his brother Abel, let's go out to the field. And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. Yeah, that's a pretty.

    "text": "Okay. Yes. So that's a good summary. Now watch this. This story is giving us language and imagery, especially the way sin gets personified. That's Going to find greater clarification way later in the Bible. There's this little paragraph in the New Testament in the letter of First John, chapter three, and he's talking about people who are children of the devil and children of God. Chapter three, verse seven. He says, little children, make sure nobody deceives you. The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just like God is righteous. The one who practices sin. Remember Genesis 4. It's the first time that word occurs. The one who practices sin or does sin is of the devil. For the devil sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. No one who is born of God does sin because God's seed abides in him. He cannot sin because he's born of God. So John's got this idea that you can either be a child of God because God's seed is in you and therefore you are a part of God's seed, or you can be the seed or the child of the devil because you do sin. And you realize this whole. All this vocabulary comes from Genesis 3 and 4, that there's the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman. But there is coming one, a seed of the woman who's going to crush the head of the serpent, which John phrases here as the son of God who came to destroy the works of the devil. But even though that's happened in Jesus, victory over sin and spiritual evil, you and I still have a choice of what seed we want to be a part of. So verse 10, he says, by this, the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious. Anyone who doesn't do righteousness is not of God, nor the one who doesn't love his brother. This is the message we've heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, not letting, like, Cain, who was.",

This is talking about baby snakes, or it's talking about people who give in to the serpent's temptation. Just like. And then you get Genesis 4, which is somebody facing another temptation. And the temptation is called sin. And you watch Cain do it, which now you realize like, oh, I'm supposed to see people who give in to sin as allowing themselves to become the seed of the serpent, part of the legacy of evil. The legacy of evil. And so that's exactly what he says here. Don't be like Cain, who was of the evil one and so murdered his brother, and for what reason did he slay him?

But there is a different seed, a different nature that I can receive as a gift. And it's to become the seed of the woman leading to the overcoming of evil, which is. That's the story of Jesus.

I read it aloud quietly to myself, and it engages my whole body and mind in a way that's very different than when I read silently. So you read it aloud all the time, and then when you read it aloud all the time, you also begin to think about it all the time. It's what fills your mind. Why did Cain do that? Why did Saul do that?

And what Psalm 1 is telling us is both ideal readers, because the producers of the Bible were these kinds of people, total Bible nerds. And so you both had to have a decade of Bible nerdom under your belt. And then the life of the community is decades of daily scripture reading, meditation and prayer, along with other day to day life activities. And so in their minds, it takes a whole community of people, a lifetime's worth of not even one human mind can comprehend everything that's going on here. You need a group of people to read and meditate on it together. And the outcome of that is this image of the tree planted by streams of water.
