So Matthew and Luke talk about Mary's pregnancy with Jesus as being the activity of the Spirit. Here, the pneuma now in the New Testament, but that's not a surprise to us. We already know that God's ruach hovers and creates life in dark, uninhabitable places, whether it's the waters or a barren womb. Or a womb or a womb. Yeah, that's right. The Spirit plays another key role in Jesus story at his baptism. And there it's really cool. So Jesus baptism, John The Baptist is down at the river. He doesn't live in a van by the river, but he is down by the river, Jordan river. And he's starting this renewal movement of the repentant among Israel. And then Jesus comes and John identifies him as the leader, the one who will renew God's people. And then as he's praying, Jesus is in the water. It says the heavens were open. Mark says they were ripped open and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in physical form like that of a dove. And then God's voice speaks from heaven. You are my son, whom I love. With you I'm well pleased. Did the baptism story so legit. So much happening here. Why the bird? Right, so just stop.

This is all Old Testament vocabulary, but it's now all happening through Jesus. So the book of Acts begins using this wind. Right.

And then they, they look at each other in the room that's full of this wind hurricane in the room.

And there's all of these Israelites there from all over the world, and they all understand and become Unified all of those who turn and follow Jesus as the people. So Israel gets renewed there. Right there at Pentecost, the tribes come together again. So Luke's trying to say this is the recreation of Israel, the covenant people of God. And then that same thing happens to Cornelius and the Gentiles. There's another outpouring of the Spirit. And then these non Jewish people are speaking in these unknown languages. Tongues, it's called. There's a lot of debate, obviously a lot of debate in Christian history about speaking in tongues and so on. In the Book of Acts, it happens at key moments where the boundary lines of God's people are broken and new people more and more, different kinds of people get included in the family of Jesus.
