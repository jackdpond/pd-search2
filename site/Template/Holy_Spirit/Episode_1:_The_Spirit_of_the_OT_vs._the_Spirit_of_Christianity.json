Another interesting thing, we don't have windows in our recording room, but if you were to look out the window and you were to see trees out in your front yard or something, and they were moving, but you can't see anything moving them. They're just like. They're dancing. Our English word to describe what it is that's moving the trees. Wind is wind. In Hebrew, you would call that the ruach. Ruach. It's the ruach moving the trees. So ruach, the common denominator between the ruach coming in and out of view and the ruach moving the trees, animates things. Is it? Yes, it animates things. And it's invisible. You cannot see what it is. You can't see your breath unless it's really cold. Unless it's really cold. And you can't see the wind. And it's connected with energy and power and animation. So we're talking about an invisible energy that animates things, that makes them move. And so think about in English. We have totally disassociated the thing that animates the trees with the thing that animates me. Right, but in Hebrew, it's the same thing. And so that, then is grounded in a deeper level, a deeper idea that's underneath both of those. Namely, where did I get my ruach? What moves the trees? What also makes the. You know, the rabbits and the birds, what animates them? Because they are around the trees, too. And then what is it that animates me? Because sometimes I go around the trees, and so there's something invisible that animates the trees and the birds and me. And in the Old Testament worldview, the thing that is doing all of that is also ruach, but it's God's ruach.",

We need to check our worldview categories at the door and understand what they meant. But what we then have to do at some point is come back and relate it to our view of the universe. And I mean, we could do it later, we could do it now. I would argue that ultimately we end up in the same place. You have a different understanding of the physical mechanisms and processes by which the universe works. But ultimately this is a way of talking about God as the originator and author of existence. And that all of existence in the created order originates and is sustained by the creator God. And ruach is. Is a way of talking about how that God is personally present, sustaining and orchestrating his world.",

But then the second sentence of the Bible, who is it that is there in the midst of tohu va vohu? That's the instrument through which God creates and it's God's ruach. So right there in the first two sentences you're like, wait, so who created God or Godz Ruach? I mean the story, are they different? Are they the same? Right. And then it's also, and it's intentionally connected, the third sentence, third verse of the Bible is then what does God and God's ruach do to bring order? And verse three begins and God spoke. And of course, speaking is precisely what you do to breathe out your ruach. So you have God, spirit of God, and God speaking a word that releases the ruach out to bring order and creation. So there's already this complex depiction of even the God of the Bible, of how is God present here in the world doing his work? It's God's ruach. Well, it's God, yes, it's God's ruach. There's some complexity to God's identity that's beginning to be explored even in this vocabulary. It's really interesting. God's ruach comes in the story of the Bible. Then to have an independent character, like it's its own ruach is its own being and character out there doing stuff. And we'll see this again in the New Testament where it's the spirit, but sometimes the spirit of God, sometimes it's the spirit of Jesus, or sometimes it's just Jesus, or sometimes there's this overlapping within God's identity. But all that to say the ruach is, in the Old Testament, a way of talking about God, the creator, God's personal life, energy, and presence here with me, which goes back to that question, where did I get my ruach? And. Right all across. It's a gift of God. So that's the Image in Genesis 2. God breathes. So God takes dirt, forms the human, but they're still not fully human. So God breathes the breath of life and animates the. So the vision of humans is that humans are creatures, they come from dirt. They also go back to it.

When you take away their ruach, they die and return to the dirt. But when you send forth your ruach, they are created and you revitalize the surface of the ground.

And that there is a personal divine presence that animates everything that exists. And that's. Or as Paul says, right in him, we live and move and have our being. He says in Acts, chapter 17.
