About a year ago, Tim and I recorded a live question and response on YouTube. We were answering your questions about heaven and earth, a video that we did, actually, the first video that we released on our YouTube channel. Many of you have asked for that Q and R to be posted on our podcast so that you can just listen to it instead of have to watch it on YouTube. Some of the questions are, why do we talk about heaven and earth and not hell? Could people have gotten injured in the garden before the fall? What's the deal with Hebrew temples versus other temples in the ancient world? And many other questions. So we're going to dig into all of that. Thanks for joining us. Here we go. Today we're going to talk about your questions on heaven. There's a video that we did on heaven and earth.",

Sean's question says, my question is the video talks about heaven and earth, but hell is never mentioned. Was that intentional? And if so, will hell be covered at some point? Yeah, great question, Shawn. It was intentional that we didn't talk about hell because we felt like we had enough ground to cover. Just in reframing the concept of heaven and earth just by itself, that's a topic that's really important. And what hell is and how it fits into the story of the Bible is itself complex and needs a lot of reframing from our modern distortions of it. So we just decided to separate those out. To separate those out. Here's but an interesting fact about that, though. If you ask most modern people in the Bible, when you think of a word pair, if I say heaven, you say, and most people would say hell, Heaven and hell. What's interesting is you will never find anywhere in the Bible heaven and hell in the same sentence. And that's because in the Bible, hell is not the opposite pair of heaven. Earth is the opposite pair of heaven. And that heaven and earth appears as a key, unified idea all over the Bible.",

Jeff Pace, you had a really interesting question about did Eden allow for the possibility of painful injury prior to Adam and Eve eating the fruit? Wondering if this is any different from how it will be in the new heavens and the new earth? That's a really great question. The Eden story depicts the commission and the task of humans in the world and in the garden as work. Gardening, like cultivating and gardening, which is really hard work.",

So in that sense, that work requires resistance and you're overcoming conflict with something, you know, whether it's dirt or weeds. So, yeah, work. In the Eden narrative, the curse in Genesis 3 after human sin is that the environment in which humans now operate because of their sin and selfishness is going to be more difficult and that their relationship to creation itself will be one of adversity or hostility. And that's depicted in this image of thorns and thistles. And I don't think we should push that to mean, therefore there were no weeds before the fall, just like there were probably mosquitoes and other types of annoying pests, you know. But it's that the environment is now complicated and fraught with hostility because of sin. And one of that will be even our relationship to creation itself. So I do think that has implications for how we think about the new creation, that we're going to have meaningful work. It's going to be work. It's going to be a redeemed, healed version of how we experience the world. Now, we had this conversation before about.",

There's no indication that you couldn't, like, chop off your thumb with your sickle or, you know, like, there's just no indication. What there is an indication of is that human beings, because of their closeness and proximity to God's presence and what the tree of life symbolizes as God's gift of eternal life, that that was possible and accessible, but ultimately that it was lost. So it wasn't the tree of you'll never cut your finger off. It was the tree of eternal life because you're in God's presence. So we don't really have any. I think we just have to humble ourselves and say we don't know. The point of the story is to say that things were set up to be as good as they possibly could have been, but we ruined it.

And we just are going to have to deal with that one. Ben Brown, you had a good question about how does the Israelite view of heaven and earth compare to other ancient Near Eastern perspectives of God's space and human space? So what we talked about in the video and what Ben's keying into is that in the Israelite worldview, the place where heaven and earth, God's space and human space overlap is in temples. And that idea is not unique to the Israelites, that was a shared idea among the Canaanites, the Egyptians and the Babylonians. So that is in common.",

And so the idea that God space and human space used to be completely united, that that was lost, that human beings have done something really wrong to each other and to God's world, and that God's on a mission to heal that rift and bring heaven and earth back together. Now we're getting uniquely Israelite. That's a unique to the biblical story and worldview. The Egyptians and most Babylonians had more of a pantheistic or panentheistic. That's a rabbit hole. We don't have to go down. But they had a different view. The nature of time is totally different. So the Israelite view is unique in that God's on a mission to bring heaven and earth back together again.",

He asked a question about what he called the intermediate period between death and final resurrection. Is there any indication in Scripture that alludes to heaven's absence of time or adherence to time? Yeah, so. So one of the most common stories used to unpack this is like, what's happening to someone, let's just say a Christian after they die, but before the resurrection into the new creation. Because Jesus, for example, as he's hanging on the cross and the criminal hanging next to Jesus, says, remember me when you come in your kingdom. And Jesus says, today you'll be with me in paradise. It's one of only three clear passages in the Bible that even talk about what happens right after death. So the question is, does that today refer to some disembodied state, or does that today refer to resurrection into the new creation? In which case what Alan, you're calling the intermediate state is just however long it is after you die. So Paul, in his letter, the first Thessalonians, uses the metaphor of sleep. That Believers go to sleep when they die, awaiting the resurrection, a new creation. So this is one of.",

And then we experience the three dimensions as we go through time. And so time is a feature of living in a material world, as far as I understand it. And so to the degree that the whole storyline of the Bible is not about escaping the material world and going to a space, spiritual, non material world, that's not the Bible or Christianity at all. The hope is of resurrection into a new physical world. And so unless there's some property of that physical world that makes it so that it doesn't experience time, the Bible just doesn't talk about that at all. But my hunch is that we would experience continuity through time the same way we do now because of our nature, just as creatures.",

The Bible doesn't go there for the rest of the livestream about heaven is that the Bible just doesn't answer most of our questions. But it's good, it's good to develop the skill of knowing what the Bible does speak to and what the Bible doesn't speak to when it comes to these kinds of questions. So Alan, thank you for that great question. This one was from Austin Austin Howes and this might be a hobby horse for some people when they think about heaven and earth and this kind of thing, or maybe not, I don't know. But it's the question about the thousand year reign of Jesus in relationship to actual heaven. What's the relationship between those two? Good question, Austin. So what you're asking about is in the book of Revelation, the way John unpacks the storyline of how heaven and earth come together, there's this idea that there's the final battle and a conquering of evil in the world and that what Jesus does is set up a thousand year reign so that the martyrs, this is in Revelation chapter 20, that the martyrs, people who have had their heads cut off, is actually who he specifies for Jesus have a chance to reign over God's world, vindicated from their suffering. And John distinguishes that from then the final return of Jesus and the merging of heaven and earth. And what's interesting about that passage is it's the only thing like it in the New Testament. Every other place in the New Testament that talks about the return of Jesus or the new creation, it just has Jesus returns, sets up his kingdom, defeats evil forever and ever, and then it's the new creation. So once again I think we have to be humble and say what John's doing in Revelation 20, it's the only thing like it in the whole Bible. So we should acknowledge there's probably going to be a diversity of views. And, and there are some people think that that is a metaphorical way to talk about the vindicated suffering believers who followed Jesus who are reigning in God's kingdom. And it refers to the period we're in now that even though they might be killed or martyred, think of the martyred Egyptian Christians who had their heads cut off on the Libyan cross coast last year. This is a live issue still today, and it was 2,000 years ago. So some people think Revelation 20 is giving a special place of honor to the Christian martyrs in God's kingdom period right now. And even though they die, they are reigning just like Jesus. His death was his enthronement as king. There are some people who don't hold that view. They think that the thousand year reign is referring to some kind of earthly kingdom that Jesus will set up here on earth, home based in Jerusalem for a thousand years as this intermediate kingdom. And then he'll bring the whole heaven and earth. If you're asking for my opinion between those two, my hunch, my strong hunch, I could be wrong, but my strong hunch Is that the first view? That it's a way of talking about the kingdom period now, where the martyrs receive a place of honor and that even though they've been killed, actually they're reigning with Jesus himself. So I could be wrong about that, but that gets into a whole other set of questions. Josh Huss. I'm looking at it on the live feed. Josh, you ask, so in regards to the end of the world, is Jesus, excuse me, is heaven coming here? Or does Jesus take us, then bring heaven to earth? That's a good question. There's differing views on that, as there are on almost everything. But in my humble opinion, and I could be wrong about this, but I don't think I am, I think the New Testament gives a pretty clear vision that when Jesus returns, he will bring his heavenly kingdom to earth and that God's kingdom will come and his will will be done here on earth, fully as it is in heaven. There is one passage in the New testament in Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians, chapter 4, where Paul uses an image of Jesus arriving and then of believers coming up to meet Jesus in the air when he returns. And that has been unfortunately misunderstood in the last 150, 200 years or so to refer to believers getting like, raptured or evacuated off of planet Earth for some period of time. And then God reigns hell and brimstone down on earth in what's called the Tribulation. And then Jesus comes back and sets up its kingdom. And that used to be the view that I held until I just started reading these passages and realizing, like, the evidence for that view, what I'm calling the Rapture view, is zero. There's just zero evidence for it in the New Testament. And this actually isn't that controversial anymore, but it was a really widely held belief and still is in especially American Christianity. So anyway, 1 Thessalonians 4 is the only place that you could get that Jesus zaps a bunch of people up and then brings them back down again when he returns. But for a number of reasons, I think that is just a fundamental misunderstanding of what Paul's trying to say in 1st Thessalonians chapter 4. What he use. Sorry, just to clarify, what he means in 1st Thessalonians 4 is that he uses a word, the meeting. The believers come to meet Jesus. And a much better translation would be to greet Jesus or welcome Jesus. It's great. Paul uses a word there to describe the arrival. How Romans would describe the arrival of the Emperor to their city is how Paul describes The arrival of Jesus in the kingdom. And when he talks about believers meeting Jesus in the air, it's not so that they go away with him. It's actually that they greet him and welcome him as heaven and earth reunite here fully. So anyway, 1 Thessalonians 4 is awesome, but it doesn't have anything to do with the Rapture.",

In the New Testament, God wants to save your soul, quote, save your soul from hell. So the question is, why the change? Is there a difference between the perspective in the Old Testament, which doesn't really talk about the afterlife very much, if at all, and then talk about that, and then the New Testament, all of a sudden it seems like it's a lot more about this idea of salvation being this just getting to heaven one day when you die, saving your soul from the possibility of eternal torment in hell.",

And so I guess there's this fear of if you're dismissing the idea of hell, then people aren't going to have motivation to do the right thing. So you're taking the teeth out of this message.",

What I'm saying is that the common popular understandings of what hell is are so distorted and actually not true to what the Bible is trying to tell us, that we need to rebuild from the ground up again. Apparently we need to do a theme video on final judgment, but you can't start there. Where you start is with the story of heaven and earth. And so in the Old Testament, the Old Testament story begins with heaven and earth united and then humanity through rebellion and giving God the F bomb, which I'm still quite proud of. That moment in Heaven and Earth video, though. We've gotten a lot of flack, a lot of flack for that one. But I mean, it was very inappropriate, which is why we tried to censor out Adam's middle finger. But that's the best we could do anyhow. So that's how the story begins. And so the Old Testament storyline is then about God selecting one family out of the nations. And what he wants to do is at least restore heaven and earth as closely as possible in and through this one family. And so Israel is that family. And so Israel was called to be a nation of generosity and justice and within themselves as a little picture of heaven and earth more united than it is anywhere else. And so, Rachel, to your question, that's why to be a good person here on earth is a focus so much of the laws, but it's not just about being a good person here on earth. That's what humans are for. We're made for justice and honesty and integrity and healthy relationships. That's like what we're. That's what we're for. And so that. But Israel, it turns out, has a rift between heaven and earth in themselves just as much as anywhere else. And so the story of the New Testament is the story of Jesus coming as the one person in whom heaven and earth completely overlap. And he comes through his kingdom to begin to do something for humans that they couldn't do for themselves through his life and death and resurrection. And then to begin through his kingdom movement and the coming of his Spirit to begin a people movement in whom heaven and earth is overlapping more and more inside themselves and also in our communities, pointing forward to the complete reunion of heaven and earth.",

    "text": "Yeah, so I'd reframe the question to say the Old Testament is about God's kingdom and heavenly presence invading more and more of earth, culminating in Jesus in the New Testament, where heaven and earth lock together forever in the person of Jesus. And then through Jesus and his kingdom movement, more of heaven is invading earth and that will culminate in his return. And so what God is saving people from is. Is themselves is from evil and the grip that evil and selfishness has on all of us from dark spiritual powers of evil that work on humans in really mysterious and odd ways. And the way that the story ends and we didn't. Again, this gets to the question earlier about where does hell fit within this story? Hell fits within the heaven and earth story as a place where God allows people to exist in their rebellion and in their resistance, if they don't want to humble themselves before Jesus and be a part of his kingdom. But hell in that word and what that refers to is a whole rabbit hole and worth exploring in its own right. But it's not someplace other than heaven and earth. It's a place where people are sustained by God's mercy and care. But God allows them the dignity of not being in a relationship with him if they don't want. That's why it's really important that our language about hell is actually true to the Bible's descriptions of it. And there's lots of different images for that. Paul, the Apostle's most profound one, I think, in his letter to 1 Thessalonians, is that it's about exclusion from the present. It's about people who don't want to be a part of the reunited heaven and earth. And God honors that decision. So a lot more to be said there. But Rachel, it's a good question. I think it really involves reframing our vision of what the story of the Bible is actually about. I don't know how to say your name. Thagotaberi the Gataberry. Anyway, you have a great question. It says, what was the knowledge of the people in the time of the Book of Kings? Hezekiah, when he learned that he had to die, he wept bitterly. And in Isaiah chapter 38, says, Sheol does not thank you or praise you. Did Hezekiah not know about heaven? That's a great question. That's a great question. There's a couple of things going on there. I would say in one sense, if by heaven we mean a place of disembodied non material existence where people float on clouds and worship God forever and ever, then I would say, yeah, Hezekiah does not have that as any part of his imagination or word.",

    "text": "Right? Yeah. And part of that is due to even the concept itself of resurrection and some kind of continued physical existence after death. That is an idea that emerges through the storyline of the Old Testament and actually doesn't come to be talked about explicitly until pretty late in the Old Testament period. So you have psalms, for example, that come from early in Israel's history where the poet, he's praising, he's thanking God for rescuing him from some disaster. And then he says, you know, God is so faithful, God of Israel, so faithful, even death can't keep you from your loving commitment to, to our people and to us and so on and so you have these poems, like Psalm 73 is a beautiful expression where he says, there's no way that death can be stronger than God's loving commitment to me in this world. So right there you have the seedbed of the idea that. And it's not speculation about life after death, it's saying God's character, he made this world good. And that death, real level is a violation of the beauty and the goodness. In some ways it's woven into the natural process of the world, but in other ways it seems like a violation. And so the idea of resurrection and life after death is born out of a conviction about God's goodness and his character and his commitment to this world. And so that's why Hezekiah is so bummed. Because the predominant view in the Old Testament is that once you die, you go to the grave, sometimes translated as Sheol. And the uniform conviction in the Old Testament is, yeah, in the grave nobody's worshipping God because they're dead. They're dead. But there emerges this hope of is it possible that the grave is less powerful than God's grave love for his world? And the Psalms and then the prophets land on the side of saying, yes, God's love is more powerful. So Ezekiel has a vision that God is going to recreate his people someday in a profound way. And then the Book of Daniel is where it comes together of a resurrection, a recreation of humanity's physical existence. And then that is what is assumed. That idea is assumed, consumed all over the New Testament. So that's a long answer, but it's an important one to say. The idea of even resurrection and new creation is one that emerged through time in the Old Testament story. Isn't that interesting? That actually really bothered me for a long time when I first learned that. And there's no way around it. That's clearly how the idea developed. But over time I actually came really to see it as beautiful. Part of the way that Israel and the biblical authors were waking up to the far reaching consequences of God's covenant love for the whole world and for creation. Anyway, sorry, I could go on.

And the answer of the New Testament to that is, yes, it happened in the person of Jesus, that his resurrection existence is a little bit of new creation. And so the resurrection stories in Matthew, Luke and John give us this portrait of the new creation. But here in the old creation. And so think about how the disciples encountered Jesus. They recognized him, and it was still Jesus physical body. And it was a body that had continuity with his body from before because it still had the scars and the marks in it of the nails and so on. But yet at the same time, sometimes they didn't recognize him. He was the same, yet different. And his body had properties that made it so that if the door was locked, he could be in the room all of a sudden, and then Jesus would be gone from the room, which.",

    "text": "Yes, but it was Jesus and he ate a meal with them. So it was this world, but it was fundamentally different from this world too. And so that's the analogy, I think, that we are to at least take up and to explore is that the new creation is similar yet different. And we just have to say we don't know what we don't know and be okay with that. When it comes to marriage, it is interesting. Jesus Got asked to question about marriage and the resurrection and so on. And it's in Matthew, I think it's 19 or 21, might be 22. Anyway, I taught on it. I teach sermons regularly at my church, Door of Hope and I have a whole 45 minute sermon on it. If you go to Door of Hope's website and look in the series on Matthew, I have a whole teaching on what Jesus talked about in the resurrection there. But in a nutshell, should I do it? In a nutshell? In a nutshell, the biblical vision of marriage is closely tied to gender and closely tied to procreation. And so the whole idea of the new creation, which opens up more unanswered questions, is that new life won't need to be generated from out of sexual intercourse, from making babies. It's not. It's about which, I mean, that raises so many interesting questions that we don't have answers to. But that's the idea is that that won't be necessary in the new creation. And so marriage in the Bible is intimately tied together with procreation. And the idea is that human communities and lives are being sustained through healthy, loving relationships and in proximity to God, the source of all life. And that's essentially what's underneath Jesus. Answer to that question. There's way more to it. So feel free to go to the sermon if you want. But great question.",

Right. But we hope that our hope will become reality one day and that our faith will be a posture that comes true. But love is the point of the whole deal.

So whatever the renewed heaven and earth are all about, it's a place of healthy, loving relationships that's safe, where everyone can flourish. And the whole point of having that vision of hope isn't that you sit around and wait for it. It's that we experience it and participate it, participate in it. Now, that's why we pray the Lord's Prayer every day. At least Jesus expected that we would pray it every day, because that's such a strange idea to have every day.",
