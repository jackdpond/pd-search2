And they don't truly image guys that they act less than human or to be true, they act like animals. And I'm just wondering, what is it about animals that is so bad or so wrong?

In the podcast, Tim, you refer to the empty throne as if you read specific the empty throne in Daniel 7. But if I read Daniel 7 in different translations, I see that in Daniel 7, verse 9, it says Thrones. And then in Daniel 7, 10, it says the court take place. So if I read that, I get the conclusion that the thrones are being set for the court. And in Matthew 19:28, Jesus tells his disciples that they will take place on the 12 thrones and they will judge the 12 tribes of Israel. I do not assume that that is specific, because in the revelation it says 2424. But my question is, where do you get the conclusion that the empty throne refers to Daniel 7, 9? Because I get the conclusion that it reverts to not specific, the Son of Man, but the court. So that's my question. Thank you.",

Daniel 7 is hyperlinked to Psalm 110, which is about a royal priestly figure from the line of David who sits at God's right hand. And whether Daniel 7 is dependent on Psalm 110 or when people debate these things, think it's more likely that Daniel 7 is keyed into riffing off Psalm 110. Psalm 110. So it was really.

The composition of Daniel is really interesting. Even though the events recounted in the book are set in the 500s, early 500s B.C. and so there are stories in the Hebrew Bible from events later. Like the story of Esther takes place well after that. Things in Ezra Nehemiah for like, decades, even a century after the time of Daniel.

One of the most interesting things among the Dead Sea Scrolls was found they're often just called the Daniel traditions.
