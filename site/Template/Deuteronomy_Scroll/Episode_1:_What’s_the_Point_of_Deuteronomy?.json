This is a big day for us here at the podcast because we've been working our way through the Torah all year, and today we get to open up the final scroll. Now, one thing that's been hard for people who read through the Torah is that it has so many ancient laws. And so I guess it's best to inform you now that Deuteronomy, the final scroll, has a lot more laws. In fact, Deuteronomy is the Greek name for the book, and it literally means second law.",

Dozens of the laws in Deuteronomy are nearly verbatim to laws that you came across in numbers, Leviticus or in Exodus. And so it just kind of begs the question, what's that about? A few are totally identical, but often there's little adaptations or changes. It's an explanation. So this renewed giving of the Torah is both recalling the wisdom of the earlier commands, but applying them in new ways for a new generation and a new situation. That's the dynamic.",

There is a narrative skeleton to the book of Deuteronomy. In other words, moments where the narrator voice comes and talks about Moses in the third person as if he's not the one talking. And actually, this is exactly where I was going to start our conversation. It is a story, but the narrator doesn't speak up except at the first paragraph. Very seldom throughout the body of the scroll. And then the whole last chapter is the narrator. So the narrative of Deuteronomy is just a small skeleton of. On which is hung long speeches that are all set in the framework of, within the narrative, a day. So it's really. It's the polar opposite of Genesis, which is 50 chapters in our modern Bible, spans, you know, thousands of years and many generations. And on the opposite end of the Torah is Deuteronomy. That takes place in a day and not even all of a day, because, you know, it's presented as one set of speeches. And you can read the whole thing aloud and I think about three hours, maybe four, depending on how fast you read. But it's like part of a day, you know.",

Whereas the central three scrolls, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, are all a unified narrative from the journey from Egypt to Sinai, then from Sinai to the border of the promised land in the span of 40 years. But in other ways, Genesis and Deuteronomy match each other as well.",

    "start": "00:07:09",
    "end": "00:07:16"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah. Essentially, in Genesis, it was the story from Adam to Abraham as far as the lost Eden promise and blessing, the story of Abraham of recapturing that and making the Eden blessing available to the nations, but through one family. And then you get four generations of that family. And it ends with the third generation, Jacob, overlooking the fourth generation, his 12 sons, and anticipating all that's going to happen in a poem. And a blessing that he gives to his 12 sons. And he says, ah, my sons, gather to me and let me tell you what will happen at the end of days. And then you get the poem Genesis 49, and it forecasts much of what's going to happen in the rest of the Torah and prophets. And so similarly, here's Moses, the last of the Exodus generation, except for two guys who were righteous, Joshua and Caleb. And he's been told he's about to die, and so he gives these long speeches. But it culminates in the final section of Deuteronomy 32 and 33, where he speaks not one poem like Jacob, but two. And he says, gather around, O tribes, and let me tell you what will happen. At the end of days, it's like exactly the same phrase. And he speaks one a blessing over the 12 tribes, just like Jacob did. That's Deuteronomy 33. But in Deuteronomy 32, he forecasts the whole story. You're about to read in Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings and the future that is described in the prophets, I.e. isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the Twelve. And Moses is portrayed as the archetypal prophet who warned Israel to be faithful to the covenant. What would happen if they don't? The exile that will follow, the atonement that God will provide to make a restoration and a new creation out the other side. That's what Moses's final words are about. Deuteronomy 32. And so just like the Genesis ends with Jacob and the 12 sons outside the promised land waiting to go about speaking these long poems of blessing and future forecasting. And so Deuteronomy ends the same way, with a generation outside the land waiting to go in Moses speaking blessings, but also forecasting of what's to come. So those are really important kind of outer frames for the Torah. And that's just the end. Like all those parallels with Jacob just happen in the last few chapters of Deuteronomy.",

Be loyal to Yahweh. Like, don't worship other gods. Don't do what your ancestors kept doing. Just be faithful and things will go great. And that block of speeches makes up what we would call chapters one through 11, from the beginning of 11 to the end of 11. So here the chapter breaks actually coincide with a movement break. So all of 11 is the last unit of the last bit. So one through 11, there's speeches from Moses and they read like straight up, like sermons.",

Okay, so we'll come back and read that first paragraph. But it's essentially just from an observational standpoint, chapter 12 through halfway through 26 is lots more laws, like a couple hundred more. Just lots. And they're fascinating. We'll talk about them when we talk about this. But many of them are adaptations of earlier laws that you came across earlier in the Torah, but they've been adapted to describe not the law as you should follow it in the wilderness as a migrant camp, but the law adapted for living settled life in the land. It's really interesting. Okay, so that's the laws. It goes 12 through 26, and then halfway through 26, 26, verse 16 on through the end of the scroll, we go back into Moses in sermon mode. And again, he's calling Israel warning them of the curses and the self destruction they'll create if they aren't faithful to Yahweh. He promises them of the blessings of Eden that will come if they do. He has a note where he's pretty skeptical and he says, I know you're not going to do it, and it's going to go terrible for you, but Yahweh won't give up on you, even if you're exiled far from the land. And then he sings those poems at the end, and then you get the little narrative at the end of the book where he dies.",

  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah. Now this is always hard to do on the podcast. It's helpful if you have a chart or a whiteboard. But the first movement has three parts. The last movement has three parts. And the way each of those movements relate to each other is in a mirror symmetry, or what you could call a chiasm. So I won't try and describe it, but if you pay attention to patterns of unique repeated words, the opening chapters, movement one through 11, and the last movement 26 to 34, have really unique hyperlinking matches where the opening and the closing movements are like mirrors, exact mirrors of each other. It's cool literary artistry, but it invites the reader to compare these different sections that are separated by a huge block of hundreds of laws in the middle of the scroll. But the beginning of the scroll and the ending of scroll have been crafted really linked together. And this is meditation literature. Once you see that, then you're called to begin joining and comparing sections of the book that are far away from each other on the scroll, but that have been designed with an eye towards each other. And as you do so, you get deeper insight into Moses message on both sides of the scroll, there's three big movements. And those of you who are going through the reading journey in the app that we'll create, where we focus on a theme, a repeated key word or idea through a literary movement. Here are the themes that we're going to focus on for Deuteronomy. So for chapters one through 11, we're going to be focusing on two key words that are linked together, which are the words listen and the words love. So Moses's sermons in 1 through 11 are recalling how Yahweh showed love to our ancestors and us throughout all of our history, through bringing us out of slavery and protecting us through the wilderness. Oh, and also how Yahweh listened to our cry when we cried out to him in Egyptian slavery. So Yahweh listened and loved. And so Israel is to respond by listening to Yahweh and showing loyal love and return back to him. So what's cool is, of all the five scrolls of the Torah, the words listen and the words love repeat with the highest density in this section of Deuteronomy. It's pretty cool.",

The only other place that compares is back in the Genesis scroll. So it's another way that Genesis and Deuteronomy are like bookends around the Torah. The themes of blessing and curse are talked about the most in Genesis and then in this last movement of Deuteronomy. So this is an amazing scroll. I know the middle part is often hard to read for modern readers, but if you really get what the first and third movements are in the scroll, I think it can really provide a little more motivation and curiosity and excitement for wading through the laws that are in the middle.",

Dozens of the laws in Deuteronomy are nearly verbatim to laws that you came across in Numbers, in Leviticus or in Exodus. And so it just kind of begs the question, like, what's that about? Why are there laws being repeated? But if you compare them, sometimes they are, like, very nearly identical. A few are totally identical, but often there's little adaptations or changes. And this little narrative intro paragraph is giving you a rationale for why you're going to come across a second giving of the Torah, which is why the name Deuteronomy is kind of on point, because that's what it is.

Well, anyway, the original Bible nerds who God used by his spirit to frame, put all this stuff together, definitely had it all memorized. To call up into your mind the earlier passage being referred to and compare them and meditate on the similarities and the differences. And what you'll find is as often very meaningful insight given to you by the differences. So that's one element of what's happening here. But then there's another one that is actually being alluded to. It's the story underneath, why the 11 days became 40 years. Remember, there's a little story underneath that that tells you why Moses would need to give a more clear explanation of the Torah in this moment in the story. And so essentially, the most simple way to say it is the audience of all of the previous hundreds of laws that you read through in Exodus, Leviticus and numbers, all the people who heard those laws are dead. Oh, yeah. And the people sitting in front of Moses were like little kids or teenagers when all those laws were given. And so this is for a new generation. You get a renewed giving of the Torah. That's essentially what's happening here. Now, that may not sound very exciting to describe on the surface, but it's a crucially important dynamic that's happening here in Deuteronomy. This is a new Torah for a new generation, which starts to set up a pattern that like, oh, I bet every generation is going to start to need its own renewed explanation of the Torah for its own time in place, because that's certainly what's happening here.",

Yeah, but they still care about what those specific laws that were given to Israel in some way, they still are instruction for them. But then you've been pointing out this pattern in the Torah itself, where there's stories of, like, updates, where, like, maybe there's a lack of completion. There isn't a law for a specific thing that's happening when to celebrate Passover if you're unclean, or what happens to your land if you have no sons.

But what they mean for us now, living in a situation, we're about to cross the river and experience a kind of life that your fathers never experienced. So this renewed giving of the Torah is both recalling the wisdom of the earlier commands, but applying them in new ways for a new generation and a new situation. That's the dynamic. And it's just going to continue a pattern where Moses is going to be presented here as the archetypal prophet, especially because the prophet is the one who mediates the word of God to God's people. And so what Moses is doing here is going to set the pattern for all of the prophetic leaders you're going to keep meeting throughout the next section of The Tanakh, which is the prophets. Because the Torah is going to come to a close here with Deuteronomy, and then Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and then Isaiah, Jeremiah, ezekiel, and the 12.",

But then once you get into the judges, Samuel and Kings, you get this group of people and they're called the prophets. And what they always talk about is how Israel is doing in terms of their loyalty to this covenant agreement and then warning them of either covenant curse or promising covenant blessing if they respond positively or negatively. And so they're like little Moses. Yeah, that's a hard word to say in plural. And so the role of Moses in Deuteronomy becomes a template for the kind of figure that Israel is going to need in every generation to keep their faith white hot, to keep their devotion. Right. Like with renewed intensity in every generation. You're going to need a calling back to the covenant, to the laws, and you're going to need a Moses figure. And that's the role that he's playing for this generation here, which means a renewed giving of the Torah. Now, the difference you're drawing attention to is you don't. Like in the book of Samuel, when Samuel is coming up to King Saul or King David, he doesn't give along new set of laws. What he calls those guys to is faithfulness to the laws given through Moses.",

So you could say it this way. Once you get into the speeches, it's hard to tell if the people Moses is talking to is the dead people of the Exodus generation, the second generation of the children. Right. It seems like that's who he is talking to on the narrative. And then sometimes it feels like he's speaking to you, the reader, like sitting way in the future. And it's really intentional. This is really intentional that Moses re giving or his renewed giving. The Torah is setting a pattern that every generation going forward is going to have to pay attention to.

I mean, I guess in the modern world where we live, the closest thing would be the kind of collective identities that we think of in terms of national identity. Yeah, sure. In American culture, depending on how invested a person is in the story of the country where you live, retelling the foundation story of what a bunch of founders did in the founding documents is usually brought up not just out of historical interest, but it's brought up because it's somehow, I believe, that implicates me as a carrier today of those values. And so you could say, you know, the original audience of the American Constitution wasn't just our ancestors. It's us. Like, we are the inheritors of that. To live out its vision today. I think that's something similar to what's Going on here. Yeah. So here's a towering figure in Hebrew Bible studies, Brevard Childs, of blessed memory. He, in his introduction to Old Testament of Scripture, names this dynamic this way. He says, Deuteronomy serves as a commentary on how future generations are to approach the law and how it functions as a guide in establishing its role in the Hebrew canon. By here, he means the collection of Scripture. The book of Deuteronomy instructs future Israel on the manner in which past tradition is properly made alive in fresh commitment to the God of the covenant. Israel's covenant with God is not tied to past history, but is still offered to all of the people in the act of commitment. Israel of every age partakes in the events of Mount Sinai. And so also the promise of God to his people still lies in the future as well. So I have, at least I've come up with a little drawing that I like to make, Deuteronomy, which is. So picture a scroll with me. And then in the scroll you have, like, draw a little picture in the scroll. On it is Moses standing there, and he's addressing the second generation. And what do we know about the second generation? Well, they're outside the land. Why are they outside the land? Well, because their parents rebelled, so they suffered 40 years of the curse of wandering in exile in the wilderness. But they're just outside the land, waiting to go into the Eden land, where if they obey the Torah, God will give them the blessings of Eden again. So all that is the narrative within Deuteronomy. But remember, the book began with a little narrative intro, and the voice of the narrator was somebody actually in the land.",

Even if you weren't, you were. And you today. So this is a big theme in Deuteronomy. Moses will be saying, listen, whatever happened in the past is not just in the past. The past is today. Every day is today. Because today is the day you have to choose between good and evil, between life and death, between blessing and curse. And so the audience of the Torah is a future generation that's still waiting for the Eden blessing to blossom in the land. They're waiting for new creation. They're waiting for the new Moses to come.
