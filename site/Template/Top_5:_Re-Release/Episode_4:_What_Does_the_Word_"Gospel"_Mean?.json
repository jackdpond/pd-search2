So thank you for taking the time to do this. So at the bioproject, one of the series of videos that we work on is called Word Studies. We'll do these short little tours. They're both word focused, but theme focused on Greek and Hebrew words. And we are currently working on as of what this is August 2019 so it's in production about the phrase good news or the words vocabulary for good news, which in Hebrew it's the verb basar and then in Greek, New Testament, the noun euangelion. So you've explored this quite a bit and I've learned a lot from you. So let's think about it this way. So when you're reading the Gospels, say Mark chapter one. The first sentence of Mark tells you this is the beginning of the good news about Jesus. Paul, obviously the euangelion, the gospel. This is thematic throughout his writings and his vocation. There's two main backgrounds that seem significant for understanding the meaning of these good news words. One is the Hebrew Bible, but the other one also is the Greek and Roman backgrounds for these royal announcements of good news that would be announced about emperors and so on. So maybe here's an interesting place to start in your mind. When you pick up the Gospel of Mark and you read the Euangelion, does your mind simultaneously go to Hebrew Bible and to what you know of like Roman propaganda? What would a reader of Mark's Gospel? What does Mark want his reader's mind to connect to when he opens with a sentence like the good news about Jesus?",
    "start": "00:04:57",
    "end": "00:06:46"
  },
  {
    "text": "The question about Mark is wonderfully complicated and also wonderfully simple in that when Mark puts that line at the beginning of his gospel, assuming it was Mark who put it there. Because there is a school of thought which says, well, the end of Mark seems to be lost. The beginning of Mark seems to be a bit jerky and awkward because he says as it's written in Isaiah, the prophet. And then you get a quote from Malachi. And how does that work? And some people have thought that maybe the phrase beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, some manuscript, sad son of God, may be a heading that somebody after Mark has put on there. Because whereas you can leave the end of the Gospel with a sort of dot dot dot it's hard to do that at the beginning. So that's the first footnote. Sorry about that. But then if this is a way of saying this is the beginning, then the answer to the question what did he mean by it? Is read the rest of the book and see. Because this is the point about word studies and I love word studies, you know, concordances and dictionaries are some of my favorite books. When people ask me which are the books that have influenced you most, I always shock them by saying actually Concordance to the Septuagint and stuff like that, because these, these are tools which get you right into the heart of a world. But as soon as you get into that world, you have to realize that people don't live on etymologies, they live on narratives. And the meaning of a word, it's its use in a context. And the context is usually a story. So what story is being told now in the Hebrew Bible? The Mevasseh, the one who announces the good News in Isaiah 40 and Isaiah 52. It's a very specific good news, where you've got Israel in exile in Babylon and Yahweh, Israel's God, apparently having abandoned Israel. And the good news is, he's coming back. That's Isaiah 41:11. He's coming back. This is the good news. And the heralds are shouting, he's coming. And then that theme, you have to wait for its denouement through the next 10 chapters or so, until in 52, you get it again. And now the watchmen are lifting up their voices and shouting, because how lovely upon the mountains are the feet of the one who brings this good news. The good news is Yahweh has overthrown Babylon. He's won the great victory, he has released his people from captivity, and he himself is coming back personally to Zion in order to be king. So it's our God reigns is the theme. So good news is about somebody becoming king, namely God.",

  },
  {
    "text": "Yeah, that's right. The royal arrival is the thing. And then, of course, in Isaiah, it's such a shock because here is the royal arrival, chapter 52. And then we get the fourth servant song. What does it look like when the arm of Yahweh is revealed? It looks like somebody who is despised and rejected and beaten up and killed. And that paradox then of course, bursts out into 54 and 55. So you need the whole narrative. You can't just take it out. And I think what's happened in our traditions is that people have allowed the word study sort of eagerness, which is a way of saying, we want to take this text really seriously. What's the etymology? Where does it come from? To serve a different purpose? Where it's assumed that we know what the gospel ought to be, because we modern Western Christians are still trying to play out the late medieval questions about an angry God and a hell and a judgment and all the rest of it. So we want a gospel that rescues from that. So at the best. We treat all the stuff about Yahweh returning to Zion as a metaphor, as a figure, rather than actually. No, that's the reality. And it's our stuff that's the later corruption. So then once you get that sense of a long period between whenever the book of Isaiah was put together, which I don't know, and I expect you don't, nobody really knows, but between then and the time of Jesus, there are lots of people who are praying and waiting and hoping and something I was working on earlier this week, the ways in which Isaiah 40:55 and the theme of consolation, of Zion being restored and Zion being a bereaved mother who is now told she's going to have her children and more. Now, that theme is picked up in First Enoch, it's picked up in Fourth Ezra, it's picked up in the book of Baruch. And these are Second Temple period books which are saying, we are still in this state of desolation and we need the good news, we need the consolation. And the New Testament fits right in there. And it says, now we will tell you the story, which is shocking in the same way that Isaiah is shocking. But this is the real good news. And here's the point about good news before we segue into Roman studies, is that the difference between news and advice, which people often get wrong, that when there was a book published by The Jesus seminar 20 years ago called the Five Gospels, and it had the Gospel of Thomas in there, as well as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. And when I reviewed that book, it suddenly dawned on me what's going on when you put Thomas in there. Thomas is not about events that have taken place as a result of which the world is a different place. Thomas is about. Here are some teasing sayings which might help you reorder your interior space. In other words, if you say that they're all really like Thomas, what you're saying is it's not good news, it's good advice. And there's all the difference in the world between news. News is something that's happened as a result of which a whole new set of possibilities opens up, which you may or may not like. But there they are. This is how the world now is. You know, and especially, you know, the death of a monarch and the accession of a new monarch or some great victory in battle or whatever. This is news. Everything is going to be different now that we've experienced this. So that's the sort of story the Gospels are telling.",

That's a very tricky one at the moment. When I wrote my biography of Paul a couple of years ago, I sent it to a leading Jewish rabbi who I know and said, can you please read through this and tell me if there's anything in here that makes you as a Jew today feel uncomfortable. And he got back to me with one or two things which I was able to correct. It was just little turns of phrase. But one of the things he said to me was, I guess if you look at certain bits of the Psalms and Isaiah, you can see that maybe Paul had a point. But from the point of view of today's Jews, you know, some of Paul's successes have made life very difficult for us, or words that affect. I totally get that. I totally understand that. But it does seem to me that that theme of the. The radical inclusion of Gentiles within the blessing, which then you can track back to the Abraham stories, though I don't think that's so explicit. In Isaiah 40,55, it does say look to Abraham, but you could read that simply in terms of the restoration of Israel. But nevertheless, both in 40 to 55 and in 56 to 66, you do have this sense, both of the massive restoration of Mother Zion and of course, the extraordinary blessing of people coming from far away and so on.",

That would have been seen as too politically dangerous. But by the second century, it's happening all over and is being mocked. But at this stage, what's happened is that Augustus came to power. Augustus Stroke Octavian came to power after the death of his adopted father, Julius Caesar. And there was a massive civil war because Julius Caesar had made it quite clear that whoever was going to run Rome was the one with the biggest army and the most effective power base. And so it was a matter of different people grabbing at power. And so Octavian won out by defeating Antony when they had already the two of them defeated the conspirators, Brutus and Cassius. So, and you have to imagine that this civil war was fought out largely in Greece and Turkey rather than in Italy itself. They went somewhere else to have their battles, as it were. But so the whole of the sort of central Mediterranean world was involved in this horrible turmoil. Which side are you on? Which horse you going to back? And does this mean our city is going to be destroyed? Does it mean we're all going to be enslaved, etc. Etc. Etc. So when Augustus then says, it's all over, we now have peace, I've settled the matter, etc. There's a kind of a collective sigh of relief. Something has happened as a result of which the world is a different place. And so they then call on various themes from ancient mythology, etc. To talk about a golden age. And Horace has this wonderful song which is all in praise of Augustus, through whose victory, you know, the world has become a wonderful, glorious place. And Virgil writes the Aeneid in such a way as to tell the whole story of Rome climax with this amazing moment. And you can sort of feel the shimmering music in the movie. Something amazing has happened. It's the appearance of a God at last. And so the thing that I find doubly fascinating is one that they use this very explicit language and that that means that in western Turkey, in Greece and in Rome itself, anyone reading the Letter to the Romans, anyone reading Mark 1, one would say, oh, we've got a clash of narratives here. Here's a Jewish narrative, but it seems to be saying something which looks rather like ours. So which one are we talking about? But it's. The narrative is. And I've tested this out with classicists because as far as I know, nobody else in the ancient world was telling a thousand year narrative with the good news about somebody becoming king as its climax. Now, the early Christians I don't think got it from Rome because they clearly are deriving it from Isaiah etc. And the Jewish narrative, the vocabulary. Exactly well. And the storyline. And likewise the Romans certainly didn't think, oh, these Jews have got an interesting storyline, let's borrow it. But somehow. And again, that inscription from Prini talks about the providence of God. I want to say it in quite a different way. Somehow in the providence of God, when the time had fully come, if you like Galatians 4, these two storylines are coming in side by side, independently, both talking about a great event as a result of which somebody who is the appearing of a God has brought peace and justice to the world. And of course the answer then is just have a look at how that played out.",

But then if they're disciples of Jesus and, you know, they're meeting on the Lord today and eating the meal together, then they're now learning these stories of Jesus, they're learning the broader narrative that makes sense of him. And this word euangelion is once again right at the center. Oh, you know, this occurred to me while I was thinking you were talking about how that word was kind of going parallel tracks in the Roman story. It strikes me that in the Septuagint of Isaiah, so we're somewhere in the 150s B.C. yeah, 150s. Somewhere in the 1000s or 200s B.C. down in Alexandria, there's Jewish scholars translating Isaiah.

The people who walk in darkness saw a great light. Those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, and upon them as the light shined.

And then the idea of the kingdom of God and the Sermon on the Mount, I find that it is fascinating because you're absolutely right. This is about what does it look like to live in God's kingdom. But for me, the most exciting thing about that is in the Beatitudes at the beginning, when for years I used to read them as simply, oh my goodness, here are all the different characteristics which I, as a disciple of Jesus ought to be exhibiting. And oh dear, this is really quite difficult. And the pure in heart and the poor in spirit and hungering, thirst, thirsting for righteousness and merciful. This is a huge moral agenda that I'm going to have to take on board. And that kind of makes me nervous and still makes me a bit nervous about. But actually I've come to read it not as here are the sort of people you need to be, because you need to be, but here are the sort of people through whom God's kingdom is exercised in the world. Because this is the big thing which Jesus met the whole time when he said God is becoming king. And people said, well, we want some signs where, show me what's it look like? And he said, well, the blind receive their sight, the lame are walking, etc, etc, blessed is the one who is not offended by me. But that wasn't what people wanted. And today we face the equivalent objection. Oh, you say God became king with Jesus? Well, look out on the street or read the newspaper. It's obvious God's not in charge. To which the answer is when God takes charge, he doesn't. I've used this phrase again and again. God doesn't send in the tanks. He sends in the meek and the poor and the hungry for justice people and the merciful and the peacemakers, etc. And by the time the people with the tanks and the guns have realized what's going on, the meek and the merciful and the poor in heart have established schools and orphanages and hospitals and all sorts of projects in order to show what it looks like when God becomes king against the day of Jesus final return, when all those things will be part of God's new world, because they were already beginning in Jesus day. So this is a whole new way of reading the Sermon on the Mount. Not Just here we are retreating from the world into a private kingdom.

Instead of which the point about Zion, since I've been working on this this last week, because of Paul's allusion to Psalm 87 in Galatians 4:26, when he says, Jerusalem, which is above is free and she is the mother of us all, he is plugging into a Jesus strand there. And it's very interesting because, I mean, you as a septuagint reader will understand this. As far as I can see, nobody has spotted that at the end of Psalm 87 in the Septuagint, which is 86, there is a line which doesn't occur in the Hebrew, which is about your celebration because of the dwelling in you. And the word for celebration is Euphranomenon, which is the same word that occurs at the beginning of Isaiah 54. One euphranth, rejoice. Rejoice. Exactly. And this is what Richard Hayes calls metalepsis. Paul doesn't quote that line, but having alluded to the Psalm, he's got that last line of Psalm 87 in the Septuagint in his head, which hooks in verbally to the beginning of Isaiah 54. And Isaiah 54 is regularly read in Jewish circles as about Mother Zion, who, having been barren, is now going to be fruitful. So here, precisely in Matthew 5, we have the same.

And so we're so fixated on that, rather than seeing that people who become people like that are people through whom God's blessing comes on the world. And I've often said to people, when looking at Paul's ethics, you know, say the works of the flesh and the fruit of the spirit, if you move to a new neighborhood, would you rather that your neighbors on the street exhibited these qualities, the works of the flesh, or those ones, the fruit of the spirit, love, joy, peace. I know who I'd rather have as my neighbors. And part of the point of early Christianity was that though people thought they were mad, they were good people to have around. People liked having them in the community because they rejoiced with those who rejoiced and wept with those who wept.

One of the things in that section of Isaiah is because of what the servant does in 53, right near the end of 53, he declares or makes righteous the many through his vicarious death and exaltation. It seems to me that ties into a major theme that's mainly developed though, in Jeremiah and Ezekiel, about the renewal of the heart to create the new covenant, obedient, loving God, loving your neighbor type of people. I've wondered in reading the Sermon on the Mount, again, this is part of the deep structure of what's going on here. But yes, that Jesus would go from y' all are the city on the hill, the new Jerusalem, which means y' all are the new covenant, new heart.",

But Richard, in that book, concentrates on what we've called Christology, or the person of Jesus, and showing how the use of the Old Testament makes it clear that for all four Gospels, Jesus is the embodiment of Israel's God. It's not just John, in other words, that does that. But Richard doesn't in that book move very far towards saying, and here's how the four Gospels explain the death of Jesus.

And this curiously, I don't know if you know, this goes way back to the beginning of my doctoral research back in the, in the 1970s when I was working on Romans and I had grown up in a tradition which said that Romans 1, 16 and 17 was the gospel, namely justification by faith. Now of course, 1 16, 17 doesn't actually say justification by faith, but it talks about the revelation of the righteousness of God. And according to some theories of justification, what Paul means by dikazu. No, theu, the righteousness of God is the righteous status which God gives or grants to those who believe. Now I think that's completely wrong, but I remember when I was first studying Romans intensively in the Greek, being struck by the fact that in 115 and then 16, Paul says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel because it in it the righteousness of God is revealed. And realizing that that sentence means that the revelation of the righteousness of God is not itself the gospel. That's what is revealed in the gospel. So what is the gospel answer? Paul said it up front in Romans 1, 3 and 4. So then I started reading commentaries and articles and things on Romans 1, 3 and 4. And I discovered a very interesting thing, that particularly in the German tradition, which has dominant in scholarship in the 19th century and early 20th century, people did not want to find the gospel in Romans 1, 3 and 4 because they wanted the Gospel to be justification by faith within a Lutheran framework. Whereas what you've got in Romans 1, 3 and 4 is very explicit messianic language, seed of David, etc. And so people would bring out all the big guns and say, oh, Paul is here quoting an early Jewish Christian formula just in order to say hello to the people in Rome. Yeah, I know this formula as well, but actually it's not an essential part of his theology, even though it's part.",

What he really means is to rescue us from the present evil age. And I would say, no, those two belong absolutely together. They explain one another. But at the same way, at the beginning of Romans, you've got this explicitly Messianic language, which I think then contextualizes all the stuff about Christos later in the letter, because Christos is not a proper name. Christos means Messiah. And whenever you find en Christo, etc, it's this is the Messiah and his people. And this was the beginning of my exploration of Romans which led me to say that Romans 9 to 11 is not simply an aside, an odd bit about the Jews, but is actually where the whole letter is going. So once one grasps that Romans 1, 3 and 4 must not be marginalized in favor of particular readings of First Corinthians 15, then this becomes clear. Now, within 1 Corinthians 15, one should be able to get it from simply the fact that he uses the word Christos. Because if this is an early formula, then there's no way that Christos is a is a proper name. In the late 40s or early 50s A.D. it means Messiah. How do we know Paul means that? Because in First Corinthians 15, 20, 28, when he's spelling out how the Gospel actually works, he is drawing Precisely on those Messianic psalms said before Psalm 2, Psalm 8, Psalm 110, Daniel 7, in order to say that the Messiah is the one through whom God is putting everything into order, and that the Messiah then is the one who must reign until he's put everything under his feet, etc. And so the messianic exposition of 1 Corinthians 15, 3, following in verses 20, following means that the two are not so far apart.",

And at the end of it somebody said, how much of this does somebody have to believe to be a Christian? And the lecturer smiled and said very little. Something about the love of God, the death of Jesus and discovering that you're part of that story. And then once you've grasped that or been grasped by it, Everything else is yours to explore, but in other words, you don't need to understand all the theory in order to. It's like you, you know, I had a really good meal in a restaurant yesterday. I, I know nothing about the science of how you cook, but I enjoyed the meal. Yeah, somebody else was doing that stuff. So, so that's, that's fair enough. So that, yes, it's much better that people think, oh dear, I'm a sinner, bad things are going to happen, phew, Jesus died, so now I'm okay. Much better than they think that. Than they think life is just a meaningless bunch of trash and I'm just going to go on the street and do drugs. You know, there's no choice. But the danger with saying God is really angry with me, fortunately he's punished somebody else and said, so now I'm okay, is that that distorts deeply who you think God is, and it truncates who I now am as a redeemed person in Christ indwelt by the Spirit. And in order to get the whole picture, you need the bigger story. And I think it went wrong, particularly in the Middle Ages in the Western church. I don't know very much about Eastern Orthodoxy, but I do know they didn't make the same mistakes as we made in the medieval period. They no doubt made their own mistakes, etc. And that's why we all need constantly to have our visions corrected by fresh readings of Scripture. This is not something which happens once and once only. It's got to happen in every generation. But it seems to me that you can see stages where the great teachers in the Middle Ages who were doing some great things in some ways are enthralled to Greek philosophy, either to Plato or Aristotle or some new mixtures of both. So that then by the time you get the reformers protesting about purgatory and the Mass, which are the two big targets, certainly in the English Reformation, what they are doing is reinstating a Platonic vision of Christianity only with a going straight to heaven rather than having to do time in purgatory thing. And with the heavenly stuff is the important thing. So what we do down here doesn't count because that would be works righteousness. So don't think that if you're a priest at the altar, you can do this magic with the bread and the wine. You know, that's their polemical reason for doing what they're doing. In other words, they're trying to give biblical answers to medieval questions. The danger is they're actually giving biblical stroke Platonic answers to those medieval questions. And what's happened since then with the Enlightenment, this is cutting a very long story, very short, is that Plato takes over and the Bible falls back so that the Bible just becomes oh, this odd old text by which we can prove our various doctrines. So that much Western 19th century Christianity becomes de facto. Now I'm in debate with people about this at the moment because there's a lot of people who still claiming to be teachers of the church really do explicitly prefer Plato to the Bible. And I think that is that saps the life and energy from the Gospel of Jesus. It means that instead of resurrection you have oh well, Jesus was taken up into heaven from where he appeared and from time to time and then we're going to be taken up into heaven as well. And that's the real thing, seeing God in heaven instead of saying no, Jesus taught us to pray for God's kingdom to come on earth as in heaven. By what right are you stripping that out of the central prayer of our faith? And in terms of mission, I think it's absolutely vital. If the name of the game is we have these souls which are exiled from heaven and we're looking forward to going back there, then mission becomes telling other people that they have souls that are exiled and that need to go to heaven. That's never the mission of the church. The mission of the church is to be the light of the world and the salt of the earth. So I mean I could go on about this all day, I sometimes do, but so I think it goes back to the Middle Ages and to the fact that the reformers who were determined to try to give biblical answers to medieval questions borrowed far too much Plato to to do so because they assumed that the Jewish context was not only irrelevant but misleading because it was about works righteousness. So we don't want to go there and see. I've run into this as well if I quote Qumran or Psalms of Solomon or 4th Ezra or whatever to explain what's going on in the Gospels or Paul. Some people I could name in America throw up their hands in horror, say oh, anti right appeals to these Jewish texts. But we know that Paul was opposed to the Jewish Judaism because that was works righteousness. So NT Wright is drawing on these naughty texts and so it's not surprising he's distorting the Gospel.",

But if in fact the Sermon on the Mount and if the risen Jesus in the last sentences of Matthew says, teach my disciples to do everything I commanded you and taught you, where do I go find that I go to the Sermon on the Mount. So even within Matthew, Jesus has a vision that how his followers will live and announce the kingdom will be this thing that he was himself doing. What else is the Sermon on the Mount about?
