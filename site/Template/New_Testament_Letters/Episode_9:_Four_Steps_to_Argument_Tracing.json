    "text": "Hey, everybody, this is Tim@BibleProject, and welcome to the podcast. Today we are wrapping up our final conversation in our series about how to read the New Testament letters. If this is the first episode you're listening to in the series or on the podcast, welcome. We do recommend you go back and check out all the episodes leading up to this one, but if you're just gonna dive in first, right here. Here's an introduction. You are probably familiar with the letters of the New Testament. They're some of the most well known books in the Bible and they're full of inspiring one liners. These are letters that Christians often quote just single sentences from. And they actually are fairly easy to read as devotional kind of grab bags where you just read a sentence or a paragraph at a time. However, we want to invite people into a more in depth and thoughtful way of reading these as whole letters. And part of learning how to do that means learning the literary context of any given sentence or paragraph in the flow of the letter as a whole. So today we're going to talk about some of the skills involved with following a train of thought from a letter's beginning to its end in the New Testament. We're going to give you some tips and skills for how to read the letters more effectively. And we're going to discuss an interesting question that comes up between John and I about why Paul sounds so aggressive, even bombastic and arrogant sometimes. In some sections of his letters, Paul was trained in ancient Greek and Roman style of rhetoric and public speaking. And so the way that he writes is really different from how we might try and develop a line of thought in a modern Western context. We're going to explore things like that and even more in today's episode. One thing to note is that John and I recorded this conversation. We were in our office a little bit different than normal, but we think it should be fine. Okay, thanks for joining us. Here we go.",

Where we're going to go now is a little more practical in how to. Which is strategies and tools to actually read the letters and notice stuff and learning how to identify what's important and things like that.

He almost always adds a description of himself. Sometimes short, sometimes long. He often names the group that produced the letter and that it comes from. He'll name people. So that's the first thing. Yeah, he rarely puts just his name. He usually puts his name in other people's names and he usually describes himself with long or short descriptions. And so here's the basic point, is that if you start comparing all the different beginnings of the New Testament letters, you'll notice when Paul or Peter or John is taking the existing form and tweaking or adapting it to the unique purposes of that letter.

Go through all of the New Testament letters and study the Thanksgiving prayer. And what you will find more often than not is all of the key themes or vocabulary that is going to be developed in the letter is introduced in that opening prayer in a really cool way. It shows that Paul especially saw the Thanksgiving prayer. First of all, it's Jewish. It's just good biblical style to give thanks to God and then to fill out your thanksgivings to God. It's like a third of the Psalms in the book of Psalms. So what he's done is taken the Thanksgiving prayer and really filled it out as a communication tool and to make these theologically and poetically quite beautiful.",

  },
  {
    "text": "Then you come to the body. That's right. Which we'll talk about in a moment. And then the final kind of main form, or standard convection, is the closing, which is actually fairly flexible, but it has common elements in it. You usually pronounce a piece.

So like in Thessalonians, he'll say, may the God of peace bless you and make you holy. Faithful is the one who called you.

Business, politics, law, relationship. In the democratic societies of Greece and Rome, success in public life depended on eloquence. It was the hallmark of civilization and the characteristic of an educated person. And while some were gifted in finding the key to an audience's heart, the majority were not. And so began the project of studying and codifying the art of persuasion in Greco Roman education. This was like a whole field that you're trained in. This is like. It's the equivalent of I think what at least the American education system is what I know of, like math and science. Now, this would be. This was one of the standard tracks.",

The most famous, kind of like Godfather, who codified and wrote the handbook that still is a guy named Democritus. But in the Greco Roman tradition, there were three main forms that you were trained in. And this was actually helpful for me because as I've sat with the New Testament letters for many years, it's helped me kind of know what mode they're in. The first is called deliberative, and it's essentially you're persuading people to do something. So you'll use examples from the past, you'll project future outcomes. You're using reason, but not always logic and not always data. You're using reason or just persuasion to get people to do something. So persuasion mode. And Paul's often in this mode when he's trying to get the Corinthians to stop doing something, he'll get into persuasion mode. Another is called forensic, which is essentially law court.

I find that this is the mode that it's most off putting to modern Westerners. Unless I guess you've been in debate class, which I just. I never. I never was in debate anyway. And then the third is what's called display rhetoric. And this is interesting because in Display rhetoric. You're actually not trying to make any new points or ideas. What you're doing is elevating certain people and values and decisions as like, this is what we're all about. You're celebrating certain choices and paths or devaluing others. This is how one John works completely. In first John, there isn't really anything new. In fact, he says at multiple points, you already know everything I'm writing to you. So you're persuading people and reminding them of what they already think they value. And you're just holding it up as like, listen, you say you value this.

Or to get a certain group of people to actually do something. So Murphy o' Connor puts it this way. He says Paul never put a pen to paper except when it was absolutely imperative. A letter for Paul always had a definite goal. He designed it to accomplish something. Lacking any mechanism to impose his will, he couldn't enforce. He was inescapably bound to persuasion.

So first is pay extra lavish attention to the opening paragraph. So very often, and especially Paul. Wow. Peter's like this, too. The opening paragraphs are of little symphony, condensing all of the main, kind of like thanksgiving prayer, but then ratcheted up. Whereas here's the. Here's the basic thing. Everything that spills out of this is going to be coming back to the vocabulary and ideas of that, of that opening movement. Opening paragraph. So, for example, if we're going to go with Ephesians, the opening paragraph of Ephesians is so remarkable. It's a beautiful poem that works in three steps and ends each step with the same phrase. A little refrain to the praise of God's glory or to the praise of God's glorious grace. There's three movements, and in good Hebrew Bible form, the first and third movements are symmetrical in vocabulary. They're trinitarian, where he's praising the Father, the Messiah, and the Spirit for blessing and choosing us. And then in the very center of the opening paragraph, he has his key point, which is going to unfold. Literally every paragraph in Ephesians is going to unfold something related to. To the thing at the very center of the opening paragraph, which is in Ephesians, Paul calls the mousterion God has made known to us the mystery. It gets translated mystery. Sometimes. Yeah.

It's to head up or summarize. We'll talk about this. To summarize or head up. All things in the Messiah, things in heaven and things on earth.

This happens a lot in the Hebrew Bible. This is what a German scholar, Martin Buber, called. We called it in German leitwort in English means lead word. It's an Israelite biblical style of communication. And the apostles pick it up where they'll have a word group or a key image that just works through a whole paragraph. And I find getting colored markers and isolating repeated words and ideas, and then you can just see it in color. You can just see the flow of thought through the ideas.

The love of Christ, the One who loved us, the love of God. And so even just like going through and with a marker, and you can just start to see big movements of thought of the Spirit is dealing with the old humanity, creating a new family.

And then he starts moving into the spirit in the new family language. Yeah, this would be like one paragraph to study versus one through eleven and just noticing what's going on here.

Repetition of words within individual bits. And then how whole themes are carried across the letter through repetition. It's a pretty simple point, but at least for me, it's taken me years of reading and rereading to really get it. Because these are just dense.",

    "text": "Step three is identify repeated words within individual paragraphs. The next part of step three is follow it throughout paragraphs. This is what you're intuiting. So if you do it through Ephesians, for example, if we wanted to do it through Ephesians, it would be about the unity of all things in heaven and earth and the Messiah. And then what you would start to pay attention to is, okay, this image of many becoming one. Things coming together, things unify, things coming under the head. The verb means to head up. Yeah. Is all going to be connected. And so, lo and behold, the next paragraph culminates with Jesus being made head over all things. Chapter two has this long thing about Jew and non Jew, the two becoming one in one body. In chapter three, it's about my role as an apostle, that Jews and non Jews are fellow heirs in the same body. Chapter four has this long bit about how we're all really different, but we all are part of one body with one spirit and one hope. So you can start to see the key vocabulary of unity and oneness in bodies summary. And it's just like a red thread throughout the whole letter from beginning to end. And it was all given to you in that first paragraph. And then you notice it in each individual paragraph, and then you see it like a thread uniting all the paragraphs. So the last step is go back, and you've got repeated words in each paragraph throughout. Now come back to those clues that helped you identify paragraphs in the first place, those logical connectors, and then take them seriously as like a building of an argument. So the opening prayer of Ephesians, verse 1:15, chapter 1, verse 15, for this reason, chapter 2, verse 1. And as for you, and then really allow those to inform the logic of how the paragraphs progress as a flow of thought. Yeah, there you go. And you feel like you're being taken on a ride. And all of a sudden the role that a paragraph plays within the larger whole, you begin to see it more as like a little movement within a big symphony. And what I have found is, as I begin to read the letters as wholes this way, the old mode of, like, treating these letters as theological dictionaries, you know, and coming to a paragraph and just taking one verse out, it almost feels wrong. Because what I'll be asking is, no, wait a minute. This paragraph comes at this point in the argument, and in light of the whole, it's making this point. And I mean, I guess you can quote it out of context and use it to make this point. And sometimes we'd be like, oh, yeah, that's what Paul was trying to say. That's a good point. I should build that into my theology. But it'll also really help you spot verses that are taken out of context.",
