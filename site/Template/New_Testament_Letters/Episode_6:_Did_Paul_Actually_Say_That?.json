    "text": "Hey, this is John at bibleproject. We're in the middle of a series looking at how to read the New Testament letters. These are the small books in the back of your Bible, written by the apostles of Jesus and written to early church movements spread out across the Roman world. Right now, we're looking at the situational context of the communities who received these letters. One thing we're going to look at today is how it's hard to know when Paul is saying something original and when he's quoting what someone else had said. And this might not seem like a big deal, but let's check out 1st Corinthians 7, verse 1. In the NIV. We see Paul write this now for the matters you wrote about. So now we're going to expect him to quote something they wrote about. And he does. He begins with a quote, it is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman, unquote. But then Paul goes on, but since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife and each woman with her own husband.",

And so what it forces the reader to do is to put together some kind of logic for the flow of thought, because it doesn't mark it as not Paul's voice. The first Bible I was given as a study Bible was a new American Standard. I remembered struggling with First Corinthians 7, trying to figure out Paul's line of thought. His opening line is, it's good for men not to touch women. And then the next line is, but because of immorality, each one should have his own wife and each woman should have her own husband. And then on that reading, marriage becomes a concession.",

Is Galatians the first or are the Thessalonian letters the first? Even if you can't decide, they're within a few years of each other. But yeah, if you read them in order, it's really fascinating because you're actually getting little snapshots of the events of Paul's missionary journeys. And it's really interesting stuff. But Romans is the last. Oh, Romans is the last before. The last one he wrote before the imprisonment. And then you get what are called the Pastorals, Titus and First and second Timothy. Second Timothy. He's writing from prison, certain that he's going to die. It's almost certainly the last thing that came from Paul. But Romans is at the capstone of his missionary journeys before the arrest and being in prison for years.

And then in come the temple prostitutes. So just lots of sex. And so Paul recommends, for the most part later on in the letter, just staying away from the temples. But these people seem to have the conviction that, listen, I don't believe in Zeus or Apollo. I don't think that idol statue there has any power over me, but my friends are going down there. I have freedom in Christ to let go. And so Paul will say, okay, right, so technically, you're not in danger of any spiritual power there, but some things are really foolish and are going to lead you to being enslaved to really destructive habits. That's his point. And so here's what's interesting. In verse 12, he's almost certainly quoting somebody at Corinth. I have Everything is lawful for me.

That's what he's talking about here. The next paragraph is.

Almost every chapter of 1 Timothy, this problem is going to surface. And so what you have to do is look at the type of statements. You have to look at the tone. Barclays second criteria.

But it does seem like you can tie it all together to one underlying problem, which is people who are overzealous about predictions about the return of Jesus and are getting really fanatical and irresponsible with it. And this really explains almost everything he has to address in the letter. It's really interesting. So, consistency. Can I paint a picture of all of the different things that Paul has to address? Can I paint? Yep. And then another criteria is what Barclay calls historical plausibility. Is there anywhere else in the New Testament where I find that this same set of issues was a problem? Is there anything in the post New Testament era, in the writings of the early Church, where we see this problem or this type of theology resurfacing?

We know this from the Book of Acts. And actually there's debate about who exactly planted and started it, but we know it wasn't Paul. So Paul is writing to a network of house churches, as we're going to see by the end of the letter. He knows a lot of people there, but there's also a lot of people he doesn't know. He's introducing himself, so that's where he is in the biblical story. And he's writing to followers of Jesus in Rome. So the next moment of cultural context. What do we know about the status of followers of Jesus in Rome? We know quite a lot, actually. If you go to Acts chapter 18, after Paul left Athens, first sentences of Acts chapter 18, he went to Corinth and he found a Jew, met a Jew named Aquila, who is a native of Pontus, but had recently come from Italy with his wife Prisca, or Priscilla, because Claudius the Roman Emperor, had commanded all of the Jews to leave Rome.

Oh, yeah, that's like. That happens Paul's missionary journeys. So just imagine this. Then you have a community of Messianic Jews living in Rome.

What he's saying in this paragraph is the Messiah made paved the way so that non Jews could be incorporated in the family of Abraham. So right now he paints it as in terms of like, rank and power. There's a group that has power and status. There's a group that's without power and without status. And the powerful should accept those without power. If you go to chapter 14, he has different terminology for these two groups. He calls one the weak or the weak in faith. Actually here I'll just read the opening lines here of Romans 14.

    "text": "History, readers of the New Testament Letters have tended to take their experience and practice of writing a letter that they've been taught and their culture and assume that's what the apostles were doing. When you think of Paul writing one of the letters, what at least modern Westerners tend to do is imagine Paul sitting by himself, maybe in a study or a room where he has like privacy and he's producing a single unedited draft that he's got to get out the door. Or Paul, he's pacing the room, talking, there's a scribe, you know, secretary, getting it all down, but still single draft. And then out the door it goes. So that's the mental image. Paul did not have a study. He was a traveling missionary. To imagine a scenario where the most likely place where you would have room to work in would never be a private place. It would be in guest rooms in inns and rest stops where you would have space for Paul and Barnabas and Timothy to get together and be like, dude, I need to send a letter to class A. Here are the issues. These are things I've taught them in the past. Here's what I want to say. And that these letters could have been in the making over the course of weeks and months in multiple steps.",
