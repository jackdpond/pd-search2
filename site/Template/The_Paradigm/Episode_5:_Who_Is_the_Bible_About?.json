We're walking through our mission statement that the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus and talking about how that's a paradigm for reading the Bible that we really want to unpack. And we're unpacking it slowly. And actually, seven different attributes of this paradigm. We've done the first two, which is that the Bible is both human and divine, and then secondly, that the Bible is unified literature. This third attribute is about how the Bible is messianic literature. Big fancy word that you don't use every day unless you're a Bible scholar, I suppose. But we're going to get at it.

Sometimes the story will pause and double back and recover parts of it or go back and focus in on certain things. But there's a basic governing story. There was even one video that we made because the first words of Genesis are in the beginning, and then in the second to last paragraph of the Revelation, the narrative ends, but saying, and they reigned forever and ever, referring back to the image of God on page one, which is God blessed them and appointed them to reign. Let them reign. So there's a governing story. And that governing story is what we're referring to in this point.

It turns out that I am an Adam because the word Adam means human. So in that sense, it is about me. The story of the Bible is about me because it's about Adam humanity. But it's about me because what the story is trying to do is create the need for a kind of human who won't fail the way all of the characters keep failing. And so it's a different way of thinking about how the Hebrew Bible points forward than maybe more typical ways of thinking about the Old Testament as predictive prophecy. Like there was a prophecy, a prediction, and then Jesus did this thing and then that fulfilled it, and that proves that he's the Messiah. But if you look at how the New Testament authors quote from the Hebrew Bible or say Jesus fulfills it, that model doesn't work for all the cases, but this forward momentum model, I think accounts for it a lot better.",
