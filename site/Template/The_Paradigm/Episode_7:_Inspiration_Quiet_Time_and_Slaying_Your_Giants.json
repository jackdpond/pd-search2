Anyways, when I read the Bible, it's not every day I try to read in larger chunks. Like read a whole letter of Paul all at once and try not to understand every line. That's where I always get hung up is I would try to understand like every single line. What did he mean by that? What do you mean by that? And then I'm down a rabbit hole and I'm confused and I'm frustrated and so being okay that I'm going to have a lot of questions and then having a community of people that I can read the Bible with, you two starting to do that with my family as well.

And then to make sense of him and why you, you know, follow him and think you do what you do about him means some wider story, but it doesn't mean, yeah. That everybody's going to have the same degree of depth and time commitment into understanding the Bible. And that's called the body of Christ.

It means you value knowing who God is. And that does mean familiarity with the biblical story to some extent. But it also means finding ways to connect with him that don't have to just be reading Scripture. It could be like, for me, I love prayer walks. It's really hard for me to sit down and just focus, but I love going on a walk and praying or thinking or reflecting with a friend about scripture or. Yeah, I just, I don't think it has to look the same for everyone. But knowing God and loving God, receiving his love, I think is a really important part of the Christian life.",

I want to dive in deep. I think it manifests in different ways for me. I'm not going to. I'm probably not going to be the guy who's going to learn Greek and Hebrew and go to school. But I think that the Bible as literary art does come to life and begin to shape me while in this community of people who. There's some people who have done that. And so that's really exciting. So I would call, like, I actually now feel like I've gone from being a post Bible Christian to. Someone would say, yeah, I want the Bible to be one of the.

My name is Emily and I'm from Kansas City. Two questions. How would you describe the difference between the Scriptures being inspired versus inerrant to someone who comes from a tradition that emphasizes inerrancy? Also, how do inspired scriptures differ from other writings where people are reflecting on God and life? For example, how do poets today who are contemplating God as they write differ from the biblical author's inspiration?

One way to translate this term that Paul uses in his. In the second letter to Timothy where he says, all scripture is theonustos in Greek, God spirited, or God breathed. So we had a whole conversation about that earlier on. So it's important when Paul's writing that he's thinking primarily of the Hebrew Bible or most likely the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, because he's talking about the Bible that Timothy grew up reading with his mom and his grandma.",

And he also believed. We had a conversation about this, and so did Peter and John, that through their guidance and instructions to the early Jesus followers, that the Spirit of God was also speaking through them and what they were writing to the Jesus followers. So inspired is just referring to this conviction or confession that these writings in a unique way, are the result of a human and divine partnership of human and God's spirit. So that what these people wrote is what God wants his people to hear, to lead them to the Messiah and to know what it means to be human in light of that. So inerrancy is actually a different term that addresses a whole different thing altogether.

It took them a long time, at least 40 days and for some longer to sort out the significance and the meaning of what happened. But we had this debate about the phrase three days. He was in the tomb for three days. Was it right? Three days and three nights? Was it on the third day? Because it was from Friday, right from Friday afternoon to Sunday morning. And you're debating about rotations of the sun. And that's a good example. And you're like, it's a shorthand phrase full of symbolic meaning from the Hebrew Bible.

Hi, Tim, John and Carissa. This is Cody from California. I am a long standing avid listener of the BibleProject podcast and am truly loving this paradigm series. My question is, should we call the Bible the Word of God? Yes. There are hundreds of moments within the Bible where it says the Word of the Lord came to so and so, or thus says the Lord and so forth. But the Bible never actually calls itself the Word of God. It even refers to Jesus as the Word in the Gospel of John. And with so much human influence upon the writing and composition and arrangement of the literature that comprises our modern Bible. The. I'm curious about calling the whole thing from COVID to cover the Word of God. Is that right? All right, thank you so much for all that you do, Cody. What a precisely worded question.",

So, for example, in the letter to the Hebrews, the pastor has this whole discussion, long discussion about Psalm 95 as giving God's word to the community that he's writing to, wherever they were living. And there's a point in Hebrews chapter 4 where the pastor just calls Psalm 95. He just says, he calls it the word of God, those to whom the word of God comes, which is the people I'm writing to. So there a psalm is the word of God. And what's interesting is earlier in Hebrews chapter one and two, he's quoting from the Psalms. And there he calls the Psalms just David.

So the biblical authors don't have a conception where if it's connected to one of the human authors, it's less divine or we shouldn't call it the Word of God. They just operate with this paradigm that God's word uniquely was communicated through these texts written by these humans. So you're right in noting that calling it the Word of God is a.

They call him Messiah or Son of God, which were the very titles that Jesus explicitly tried to avoid using in public. But both are true, but just based on their different contexts in the moments in history, different vocabulary serve different purposes.

    "text": "However, I do think you can pay attention to the structural clues of the Tanakh and which we were paying attention to earlier about the, the Psalms, as the third section begins with a five part scroll. The Psalms matching the five part Torah at the beginning of the collection. Chronicles is a retelling from Adam to the exile and the return from exile. So it's very much a concluding type of story. So I do think there's intelligent life in the design and collection of the Tanakh. However, did all Jewish communities perceive that one and then two? Were there some Jewish communities that also revered other texts of more recent origin that they didn't conceive of as part of the Tanakh or they thought the boundaries were blurry and so they held other texts as having a divine human origin? And we know the answer to that question is yes. And whether it's the Messianic community Jude belonged to. For Enoch was very clearly revered. He wouldn't quote it otherwise. In the Dead Sea scroll community, there was a scroll called the Temple Scroll. That's an amalgamation of all of the apocalyptic temple visions in the Hebrew Bible to talk about a temple that is yet to come. And they accepted it as a word of prophecy about the restoration of a new temple when the Messiah comes. And they held it in very high regard. So the trick is, right from the beginning of the Jesus movement, there were a variety of communities because it was never centralized after it scattered out of Jerusalem. And there were communities, and you can trace their history into the 2nd, 3rd, 4th century that held a more blurry, wider collection of Greek scriptural writings. But there were always voices too, that said no. But the Jewish communities always held this particular section, the Tanakh, to be a unique divine human word that's different from all the others. And Jesus and most of the apostles see him on that train because they use unique vocabulary when they quote from the Tanakh, that's different from when they will borrow language from some of these other writings. So I'm compelled that there was an entity called the Tanakh. It's the 24 scrolls. But that doesn't mean that every Jewish community recognized that as a firm boundary line and that even some of the early Messianic communities, this has been an issue of, issue of debate. And so in the medieval or early medieval codexes, codices of the Greek translation of the Bible that were produced by Christians, these all have both the Greek translation of the Tanakh and other Second Temple writings in them, and the New Testament writings. And so when the English Bible started to be produced, the earliest Geneva Bible, the earliest King James Bibles had this wider Second Temple literature in it. And it was the Catholic Protestant debates that led to the production of Bibles that put these books separate as an appendix was happening in the first decades after the printing press. And then as the centuries went on, they were just removed altogether from Protestant Bibles. So it's important to say when Protestants removed them. In one sense that's true, but in another sense, they were just recognizing something that some Christians had always thought, namely that the Tanakh is a very unique revelation of God's word to his people that's different from these other books. I'm sorry, I just talked for a long time. But maybe the biggest takeaway from this is it's complicated and it's not simple. And this used to bother me for a long time. I mean, it really bothered me for a long time.",

And in one strand, in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, there's a couple more Enoch and Jubilees. And in each of those expanding traditions, it's saying, in these books, we hear a word from God by which we evaluate and measure claims about the will and purpose of God in the world. So that's what the word canon means. It's a Greek word that means a measuring line or an evaluating line. And so the confession has been that the canon of Scripture guides God's people to measure what we can say reflects the will and purpose of God. And so the trick is what collection is the measure. And there's not a lot in these books that, like, is really out of the ballpark completely, you know, in the Deuterocanon or extra books, that's like, whoa, that's coming out of left field.

But you read Maccabees, and Maccabees reads like a propaganda document for the Maccabean regime that came in revolt in the 160s. And you're like, whoa, this is a different pool I'm swimming in right now. So there are differences even within the Deuterocanon of what the text agendas are and what, what they're about.

There's a whole section that says these are the words of Solomon that the men of Hezekiah assembled. And that's like centuries after Solomon.

This is a fascinating rabbit hole in the history of biblical studies. I'll try not to go on for too long because I've been really interested in this. So a discussion about the source material of the Torah in particular, it goes. It's very ancient, it's a very ancient conversation. But in Germany in the 1800s, it took on a particular focus. The scholars who are really the engine behind what became known as the Documentary Hypothesis or jedp, are a number of scholars. Carl, Buddha, oh, somebody, Graf, Graff, and then Wellhausen, Julius Wellhausen. And for them it was both about using divine names as a way to peel apart the sources and try and reverse engineer the Torah. But it wasn't just that. It was a whole model of reconstructing the history of Israelite religion. That's what they were really after. And they had this concept that the Israelite religion developed from key male individuals who were inspired by the prophetic genius of God's spirit that encountered God and led the people. And then what happened throughout Israelite history was a degrading of that into a form of legalistic religion. And so they aligned the sources J, E D P in this order from like poetic, prophetic, inspirational down to legalism and phariseeism. And so the last source P is most of the ritual stuff in Leviticus and so on. And so in that whole model is a deeply anti Semitic agenda and a deeply unhistorical understanding of the history of Israelite religion.",

So whatever lessons it has to offer me, it's seeing how the story of David and Goliath fits in to the larger themes of the Hebrew Bible as being leading to the Messiah. And then once it's about the Messiah, then it becomes about us, because we are. If you're a follower of Jesus, you're part of the body of the Messiah. And so it's as messianic literature that it offers wisdom to me. And I think that's important because who. Who does one identify as the giant? What's the giant? So in the story of David and Goliath, the giant, the Goliath is. If you've been tracking with the narrative patterns from Genesis, Goliath is a narrative image that is bringing together a whole collection of bad guys and forces throughout the story, beginning with the snake, because.",

To the snake, to the archetype of the snake. And so once you have reptiles and giants, and that's a pattern that keeps repeating in all kinds of stories right through the Torah and prophets. When you get to the Dave and Glass story, he's facing off against the seed of the snake. It's a story about the conflict between the seed of the woman and the seed of the snake. So what is the messianic reading of that, then? A non messianic reading is, well, so you reader or listener, like David and who's your Goliath? But in the Hebrew Bible, it's creating this portrait of spiritual evil that hijacks human communities and nations and institutions represented by their violent warrior leaders. And so to me, it's crucial that we read this in light of its messianic fulfillment, because Jesus was facing his Goliath in the form of the Roman and Jerusalem power regimes. But crucially, he did not chop up their heads. In fact, for him, he wouldn't be faithful to his calling as the Messiah. If he did chop off their heads. The whole point was that he let them chop off his head, so to speak. And if you don't read the David and Goliath story through that messianic lens, then you get the opposite wisdom from it that you're supposed to get interesting.

This is what trauma does. Right. As I understand it. And so it's much more difficult than just saying, well, here's some new ideas to approach the Bible with, because it's not about ideas. It's also about your body has been shaped in such a way that it goes into fight and flight when certain issues and circumstances come up. So it's a very important question. It's not something that we can answer for someone else because it's going to be so different for every person. You know, one idea is that because that type of harm happens in faith communities by other people in faith communities, that most likely the way forward is not going to be by just a new idea of reading the Bible, but it's going to probably happen through relationships. In a community of relationships where some followers of Jesus are living and organizing their common life in a way that is healing and that feels safe and compelling and beautiful. And to see that community life around Jesus happening, and then to see, like, oh, wow, the Bible plays an important role in why these people are living the way that they're living. I think that can. In other words, it's not just going to be about the Bible. That's most likely going to be about finding a community that's living out the biblical story in a way that can bring healing. It's hard for me to imagine another way forward for someone who's in that situation. And that's just a tough place to be.",

Like there's, every situation is gonna be different, but perhaps there is something in just, let's just go and read the teachings of Jesus or let's just read stories of Jesus and then let the Bible begin to unfold from there slowly. Or just talk about the stories of Jesus and not have to like go and read the actual text because maybe there are, maybe the weaponization was a very specific phrasing of something Jesus said and then was twisted and turned into something that was abusive. Perhaps. But how can you still center it on Jesus and then let God through time and community and safe relationships begin to pull back those things so that your body can begin to interact with, with these, with these words again in a way that isn't triggering?",

In my experience, I mean, I haven't experienced spiritual abuse or spiritual trauma, but I have experienced other kinds of traumas and that has affected the way that it feels to read the Bible. And I remember the first time after I experienced a trauma four years ago of having this painful sudden divorce and finding myself with a tiny new infant and feeling like I really needed God's care and that I needed to know that he was stable and steady for me. And I remember reading the book of Genesis for the first time after that and I got to the story of Hagar and I was like, I can't read this. I just don't want to read this. And I can't because it felt triggery and unstable and uncaring. And I think, yeah, I think from my experience just having the self compassion to be like, I think God understands that and he cares and he doesn't need me to like push through, to be a good Bible scholar and read my Bible like this. Like if I'm, if I need to just connect with him, however I can receive his love, whether it's through community, whether it's through like prayer, whether it's through feeling the grief and just crying and feeling the refuge that God provides. I think he understands that and it totally makes sense that when we go through hard things, we're going to feel it.",
