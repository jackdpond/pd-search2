So Genesis, for example, the author has designed the scroll through large scale patterning, broken the book into four sections that we're calling movements.

Small, smaller, smaller. So biblical literature is organized like that. And a great example of this is actually the first main literary unit of the Genesis scroll has such a clear structure, you can't miss it because it's organized in the seven days of the creation story. And as a shorthand, it's easy to refer to that as, oh, that's the Genesis 17 day creation story. But if you go read it, the seventh day has been chopped off of chapter one and made into the first Three verses of chapter two. Why? I have no idea. It's like the least helpful organization you could imagine. Because you're like, why would a chapter begin in the culminating last moment of a story? So that's a good example.",

They give clues through word usage and conventions, repeated words, transition pieces, the beginning of a unit, the ending of a unit. And it requires a skill set to learn how to pick up those signals.

And a good way to think about that is if you read poetry, if you're reading Hebrew poetry and you see two lines right in a row that seem to say a similar or same thing, you can tell they're designed to mirror each other and play off each other. That doesn't just happen in poetry. It happens throughout narrative, too. But each line relates to the next and is designed intentionally. And so that happens. Yeah. On the micro level, all the way up to the macro level. And it's the same kind of skill that you use at both levels.",

It's cool. Ancient synagogue from like, I think the third or fourth century A.D. and there's all these cool. Some of the oldest tile mosaic depictions of biblical stories in the synagogue. It's really cool. So some of them are big and you can back out and get the whole picture. But what you could do is zoom in to any one section and then really pay attention to the meaningful organization of that, you know, maybe a two by two square. And then you could go in and just look at the organization of a little 6 inch by 6 inch square and be like, oh my gosh, like, that section is super intentional too. That creates the effect when you're zoomed out. But you go in and like, there's all these cool ways that's been organized that way. And that's basically it. It's on every level, from biggest down to small. Literary design and structure is a very meaningful way that the biblical authors communicate their messages. And so we want to help people develop the skills to do that. And we're going to start with this in the app in 2022 with helping people see larger movements of biblical scrolls.",

And within each movement, we're going to be tracing a biblical theme. Which brings us to the third skill.",

So if you see there's being given a meaningful structure at every level of organization, what is it that tells you it's meaningfully organized in a tile mosaic? It'll be color patterns. It'll be, oh, here's like an orange stripe that goes down in this section. But when you really zoom in, you say, oh, that's an organization of these orange tiles in this pattern to create the effect of a line through that whole section of the mosaic. So when you're reading biblical literature, the analogy or the parallel to color in a mosaic is words. The repetition of words over different expanses of a scroll connect ideas in the reader's mind that help you see a progression or development of whatever idea is signaled by that word. So again, these are things we've been showing and doing in our video content and podcasts for a long time now. We call them various titles but we've organized it all in a way that was helpful.

So one skill to develop is how do you find out what the meaning of a word is in Ancient Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, represented in a translation, whatever you're reading. Like, how do you study words in the Bible just to figure out what they mean in the first place, if you are wondering about that. And so we've made video content about this. You and I, Krista, have both written word study videos and had conversations about them on the podcast. So words are the basic building blocks or the basic tiles of the mosaic of any scroll. I'm mixing metaphors now. So that's the lowest level. Metaphor developing skills to learn how to study words in the Bible. It's the lowest level. The next level up is when a word or related words gets repeated throughout a number of units in sequential order, or just gets repeated throughout a larger. Like a literary movement of a scroll.

When you back out from just looking at one story, like water in a Genesis 1 story or water through a section of stories, what you'll notice is another level of patterning. And we Call this narrative patterning. So this is where a whole network of words that you would maybe not think are related, but all of a sudden there'll be a story that starts using a whole bunch of words related to an earlier story. And what the biblical authors are doing is teaching you to see how these two narratives or units are patterned after each other. So for podcast listeners, you already know this. This is how the Garden of Eden narrative, for example, the failure narrative of Adam and Eve at the tree, that whole story is filled with so many words that you wouldn't think are related. Garden, tree, bush, beautiful, eating, good, desire. See, take nakedness, these kinds of things. And these are unrelated words, apparently, at least in terms of their meaning.

And then you can scale up even one level up bigger for what we're calling melody, which is another term we're using from symphony. So this would be a whole sequence of literary units, like a creation narrative with a seven day pattern or the number seven, then a failure narrative, then a division story that leads to a crisis where God brings about some kind of de creation, but rescuing a remnant and delivering them so that they can try and become Adam and Eve 2.0.",

And this is all building towards a Bible reading experience where eventually you could be in any movement, tracing any theme. But it's gonna take us a while to get there. So this is where we're gonna start and it's gonna be wonderful. And the app is gonna be available wherever you download your mobile phone apps. And so we really encourage you to get the app and start this reading experience with us on the podcast. We're gonna actually next year go through and discuss all of these hits in more depth, all the hits for the themes in the movements. And so you can follow along in the podcast as well to even get deeper into this. So that's it. Thank you. We have one more episode this year and it's just gonna be a short episode where we reflect on the year and then we'll see you in the new year reading the scroll of Genesis.",

And it's the very thing that I take in calling God's invisible, energizing presence. Ruach is a metaphor. Whatever beautiful mind is behind all of this, the first uncaused cause, so to speak, that generates and animates all of this and sustains it. This must be a result of that being's Ruach.",
