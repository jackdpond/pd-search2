Well, actually, it begins in the creation narrative in Genesis 1, where God gives seed bearing trees, fruit bearing trees, as this gift of life. It's a good thing for humans. And then in the second creation story, there's a really extra special tree, the tree of life, and it's in the center of the garden, which is in the center of the land, which is this hot spot where heaven and earth are connected. And so trees. And in the Bible, this theme is already really connected to this idea of being in the place where God and humans work together as one. Eden and tree in Hebrew can refer to what we think of as a tree, like an oak tree, but it can also refer to what we would call a bush or a vine. A wooded kind of plant.",

And he goes there to a city and he lies about the identity of his wife in the city. This has happened before a second time. Yeah, yeah, totally. And that's actually part of how, you know. It's the beginning of a new part, is in the first part of Abraham's story, right after he was given the blessing, he lied about the identity of his wife and put her in jeopardy. Put her safety in jeopardy. That was the first thing he did. Now Abram just received another promise of blessing and a son.

Then right after that story, you have another narrative about Abraham and That king, the king that he had conflict with. And now it's a story about how that king wants to make a covenant with Abraham because he sees that, hey, God is with you.

So it's kind of a story about Abraham and this king, Abraham and the non chosen son Ishmael. Then a story about Abraham and that king again, and then a story about Abraham and the chosen son. So it follows a neat symmetrical kind of pattern and there's lots of hyperlinks and connections between the stories. But it's all about remember, the whole thing is the nations are going to be blessed through you and your seed. And that's exactly what these four stories are exploring and meditating on how the nations get in on the promise. But what if the promise is put into the hands of a guy who is a lying treacherous snake whose family is dividing?",

And then what does that mean for the future of the family? Well, it's going to mean the singling out of the non chosen and God's going to take care of them. Though it's sad that there has to be a division of the brothers in the first place. And then what we're going to see is God is even going to ask for a division between father and son. Abraham is going to be asked to give up the son on whom the promise hangs. Which brings the whole story to a crisis because it's like the whole thing depends on this. So that's the arc of this section of the Abraham story. So lo and behold, trees play a role in Genesis 21, the story of Abraham and Ishmael, Genesis 21, the story of Abraham and Abimelech, and the story of Abraham and Isaac.

So there's many wordplays crashing together.

And so the nations make peace. They make a covenant with God's chosen line. The story says Avimelech got up and Phicol, captain of his army, they returned. And so you know what Abraham did? He planted a tree, a tamarisk tree, at the well of Seven, and he called on the name of Yahweh, who is the eternal God. So what's great is the whole story builds up the Eden imagery, or rather, it waits till the end to place all of this whole scene at the well of Seven by a tree where he's going to meet with and worship and call on the name of Yahweh. So when the nations make peace with the chosen one, when the chosen one will sacrifice and give seven to enter into a covenant, then there's peace in the land at an Eden tree.

And so it creates this pattern at work that because humans are so screwed up and they hurt each other so much, it seems like the only way forward now is when God's chosen ones are willing to surrender everything over to God and that those are the moments when God's Eden blessing can break out over to the nations. Yeah, it's a powerful story. The last time the tree of life imagery appears is actually in a story about death. The last part of the Abraham story is a really interesting little section.

Ooh, her name sounds like the word blessing. And so there's that whole story. And then the next story is Abram marries again and then he dies and he's buried in the same cave. So this is all about birth and death. The passing of one generation, the birth and marrying of the next generation. So definitely death is both signaled here in this double death of Sarah, then Abraham, but then also the new life. And blessing is signaled by the birth and marrying of Rebecca and Isaac that opens up the door to the next generation. So that's kind of this last section here. But this cave, dude, this cave.

And there's traces of that when we say bless you after you sneeze. At least there's a hope that my word will bring about the health to you instead of the cold. The biblical meaning of blessing is performative speech. And when God speaks, it brings it about. And then when we speak it, what we are meaning is that we pray that God will bring a blessing to you.",

The Bible is beautifully designed literary art, and we're learning to read it through its own structure and to see its own themes. You can develop these skills in our new Bibleproject app. It's free on iOS and Android. In fact, everything we make is free. This podcast, our videos, the app, and it's all free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you all over the world. Thank you for being a part of this with us.",
