And they just read the actual Bible as opposed to rely on the versions of the stories that they were given through teaching or something. There's a whole phase usually of the Bible creating all these problems for people. Actually, John, you lived there for quite a long time, so this is a very common issue. The portrait of God is complex and difficult to process. And I just thought you were doing a character of God series.

And I guess for me, when I think about questions like this for myself or for other people, it seems really important to acknowledge that there's space to ask those questions and there's space within even the Christian tradition to not know the answers to those things. Like to just recognize that a lot of people think differently about these issues. Like some people read the Old Testament and think this is an ancient document that, you know, is written by ancient authors who were accommodating or God was accommodating their culture and their style of communication, or God was actually accommodating and how he acted within history. Or there are just a lot of different ways that we can, we can read and interpret scripture. And I guess it's just, it's helpful for me to recognize that there's space within the Christian tradition to ask these kind of questions and think about how we interpret.",

  {
    "text": "Yeah, that's well said on both of those points. So however, you know, there are, there are ways to get an angle to make some sense forward movement in our understanding. This is actually kind of a surprising perspective that I find keeps helping me process this. And it has to do with the composite Mosaic character of the Bible. So, you know, these texts emerge from. If you take the Hebrew Bible but then add the New Testament on, we're talking about, oh, over a millennium long process of the collection and shaping of these texts. And so the biblical texts incorporate stories and poems and laws and all kinds of stuff from all these periods of Israelite history and experience. But they have been brought organized together with patterns and a message and so on. So that's what our whole how to Read the Bible series is about. But it does create a challenge because when I encounter like you, John or Carissa, and we work together and we see each other on a regular basis and pretty much, you know, your behavior is consistent from day to day and you start to build up a portrait over time of like, oh, here's how Karissa is. This is her character that I infer from your behavior. And then let's say you get to know somebody long enough and there'll be something extreme that happens and then there'll be some new aspect of their character. And like, whoa, that's. I didn't see that. And so there is something kind of analogous like that to the Bible, but it's actually more complex because it wasn't all written at one go. And so the way God behaves in one story and then the way God behaves in another story, he'll like, judge a whole city and destroy it, but then he'll forgive a murderer like Cain, and you're just like, what? What's the deal? And so what we have to do, and what Christians have struggled to do, is in adopting the Hebrew scriptures, putting them alongside the stories of Jesus, the writings of the apostles, we have this huge project of synthesis that lay before us of how to create a mosaic portrait of God's character out of all of these pieces from different times and places. And I think that's essentially the challenge is finding the continuity. And so what we're emphasizing in this series is that the Yahweh of the Hebrew Bible is actually a lot more generous, gracious, and compassionate than most people tend to think. What we're not focusing on, but which is true, is that Jesus is actually a lot more aggressive and intense and judgmental than people often make him out to be. He certainly didn't get crucified for telling people to love your neighbor. He got crucified for critiquing publicly the religious and political authorities of his day. And he was very intense with them and said they were going to be destroyed. So I think part of it is we also need to learn how to augment this. Old Testament is the angry God. New Testament is the loving Jesus. Those caricatures don't do justice to either. So those are two factors that have been helpful for me as I go in to think about individual texts.",

We're talking about those words through the whole Hebrew Bible and then how those things come to fulfillment in Jesus. So I think this word study series in particular really highlights the. The character of God in the Old Testament and the character of Jesus in a way that shows continuity.",

    "text": "Yeah, that's right. So I do think part of what it means to be a Christian is to read the Old and New Testaments together as a unity. But that doesn't mean they're uniform in all their depictions of God. That's what I was talking about a few minutes ago. They're a mosaic that come from a lot of different places and times. And so the goal is to create an overall synthesis and read each individual story in light of that larger synthesis that really culminates in Jesus. And so it's tricky. It's learning to let that bigger picture inform how I read individual stories where God might behave in ways that don't seem to fit with Jesus. But then what I find is over time, there are fewer and fewer of those stories. There are still some, for me at least, stories about what God does that doesn't. They're harder to fit.",

What I'm saying is it's not just an ancient idea that God is the vindicator of the oppressed and that he deals harshly with violent, oppressive nations and rulers. That is still good news and a real hope to a lot of people right now, today in the city that I'm living in, you know, so I think there, for example, you know, Psalm 137, we sit by the rivers of Babylon and weep.",

So I think what you just said earlier about the violence in the Bible, the violence of God in the Bible also applies to this. There's space within the biblical tradition itself for God's people to cry Out. And none of these poets actually did these things to other people's babies. They're just saying what they feel and what they wish God would do. And to me, it's amazing that the Bible is endorsing that. We bring all of our emotional reactions before him and pour them out before him in prayer. So that's a good example where something that might, to some people seem really off putting. But I think if you really begin to ponder who's writing this in the Bible and why, usually it takes me back to school and I have to eat some humble pie.",

You know, something that I recommended as a pastor for lots of people, especially when people were new to the Bible, is just hang out in the Gospels and just read the Bible for a while as if all you have is the four Gospels. And after long, you'll realize that you need the whole Bible to understand the Jesus portrayed in these four stories. But Jesus character, even with his intensity, the amazing character that has been compelling to people all over the planet for 2000 years, just shines and allows, I think, forces you to go back into the first three quarters of your Bible then and say, if this whole section of the Bible is leading up to the person that I'VE been thinking and reading a lot about in the four Gospel accounts, then it just changes. I don't know, it just changes how you read the Old Testament and then find some good teachers, books, videos, or resources to help guide you through the Old Testament. Because a big part of it too is the culture gap between us and the world of the Hebrew Bible, where the depictions of God make a lot more sense in light of the cultural context of ancient culture.",

Trying to just see the details of that text, which would be important. Yeah. Trying to see the overarching message of the story. I think that's helpful. Recognizing that God is complex, like you said, this is a kind of more human centered approach, but dealing with the places that our picture of God comes from. So when we come to the Bible, we have all these assumptions about what God is like from the get go. And some of those things are healthy and some aren't. Some. Some of us have a hard time dealing with anger or angry depictions. Maybe that's a really big one in our culture.",

    "text": "Yeah, totally. Yeah. So these are both later biblical passages that address the very topic that's raised in Exodus 34. 7. Gold star, double high 5. Joni and Trinette. So maybe first to summarize what we talked about or what I remember us talking about, the three of us in our conversation. Our first conversation about it was 1, Exodus 3, 4, 7. This line about God visiting the iniquities of the fathers and the children. This is not the first time that that line appears. That's actually a restatement, a second restatement of something that God said in the Ten Commandments. And the more I thought about that, the more I've realized how significant that is, because it's kind of like uploading again, but assuming you remember the first statement of it. So I'm just going to read it again. It's Exodus 20, verses 5 and 6. But this is the first statement of this idea, and it clarifies in a big way the questions that are often raised of the restatement in Exodus 34. 7. So he's saying, don't make any idols. This is verse 4 of Exodus 20, verse 5. Don't worship those idols or serve them. I, Yahweh, your God, am a passionate God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers, on the children, on the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing loyal love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commands. So just the main difference you can hear the difference is that what it's saying is that these third and fourth generations, it's talking about a generation where every generation is perpetuating the idolatry of their ancestors. And contrast, the thousands of generations are the enduring generations of which everyone loves me and keeps my commands. In other words, your summary of what you just said a moment ago, John, isn't just our interpretation just because we think that that's the right thing to say. It is actually what preloaded in the statements mean the first time they appear.",

But this has not been my experience. My biological grandfather was an alcoholic who left his family when my father was very young. The ripple effects of his sins have been felt by my father, my siblings and I, and by my own children. This is how I've always understood these verses. My sin will bring suffering to those who come after me. Is there anything to this concept or am I just way off? Yeah. And thank you for sharing, Thomas. What a vivid personal example. I think clearly your own experience bears out a really common pattern in human families about later generations suffering.

Well, the question is, how seriously do I take God's words and purposes that seem to turn a corner precisely because of Moses? Was this God teaching Moses something?

At this moment, I would reframe it and say it's less about God teaching Moses something, and it's more about the narrator trying to teach the reader something about how God relates to people. Namely that God truly wants to partner with humans and that God has made his own purpose vulnerable to human action. And I think that's the nature of God is revealed in this story is that at least in interacting with creation, he self limits to make his purposes truly relational.
