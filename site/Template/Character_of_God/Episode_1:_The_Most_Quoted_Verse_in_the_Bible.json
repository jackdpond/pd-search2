It was my kind of main theology mentor in seminary professor Gary Brashears who really put these two verses on my radar in a significant way. I don't even remember, I think it was a theology class. But he's the one who first showed me that this is first of all, it's the first description of God's character that you come across as you're reading through the Bible from page one. So you watch God say and do a lot of things, but it's the first time that God's own character is described in some kind of summary. But then second, he was the one who told me that it's the most repeated re quoted verse of the Old Testament within the Old Testament itself. And so I have Gary to thank for putting me me onto this.

This is the moment that Moses is in a cave up on Mount Sinai and there's a divine storm cloud passing by because Moses asked to see God's glory and God passes by in a storm.

And what we found was this tension. This is what you were feeling, John, of like, what is God like? If I just look at this first description of God in the Bible, well, it's a balance of mercy and compassion and patience, but also a very firm sense of justice and accountability and recompense. And the first three, like mercy and compassion, make our hearts warm and fuzzy. And then we hear judgment or justice and recompense. And I don't know, for many of us, and I feel it too, we start to get a little uncomfortable. And I think there's cultural reasons for that in our cultural setting for why we start to squirm a little bit. But it's just interesting to pay attention.",

I've totally heard people talk about this before as if it's something that the Bible teaches. So yeah, that's. That does sound intense if in fact that's what it means. So we'll come back around to that, I think by the end of this first conversation. So first, however, I think it's good to just sample this again. The language of Exodus 3, 4, 6 and 7 gets repeated or re quoted or reused. I used to say over 20 times in the Bible, so I've got 27.

And that makes sense because he was the one who first heard them. So numbers, chapter 14. This is the story of the spies, the rebel spies who go into the land and then come back. You guys know the story? It's a pretty famous story. So 10 of the spies give a report that, hey, you know the promised land, it's awesome. Look at the grapes. They're huge. They're carrying these huge grapes. But then they say, but we also saw huge cities and huge people. The Nephilim, they say are there. The group called the Anakites or the Anakim, who are descendants of the Nephilim. Yeah. From the flood story. So that's intense. That's not a place you want to go hang out. And so totally. So the tenant spies said, no way, we're not going in there. Yahweh can't deliver us from those giants. We're going to die. But two of the spies, Joshua and Caleb, say, oh, it's no problem. Like God's, you know, he can take care of giants. He's done it before. They don't say that, but that's the way the design pattern works. And so the 10 rebel spies get the whole people into a riot and the people want to actually appoint a new leader and go back to Egypt. That's the scene right here. So what God says is exactly what he says in the lead up to God saying this about himself in the book of Exodus. He says, I'm done with these people. I'm going to destroy them and start over with the new people. And so what Moses says, what he responds is these verses in Numbers, chapter 14 verse 17. One of you should read it.",

The Ten Commandments appear twice in the Old Testament. We've talked about this before.

But when we talk about these thousands that get love, loyal love, we're talking about thousands of generations who stay faithful to the covenant.

The passion that arises within you when you see somebody that you're covenantally connected to giving their allegiance and their well being over to someone who will hurt them. So one of the important other times kanah is used is of a husband and a wife, where a husband hears or is suspicious that his wife is sleeping with another man. And this is in numbers five and it says if a spirit of kanah comes over him. Yeah. And so it's passion for his covenantal partner, for his wife.",

But then there have been other times where one of my sons has come home from a couple hours at a friend's house. Just the vibe he's giving off and, like, and the words he's using. And it's like, I realized, like, oh, he was exposed to a different value system just now, and he's treating his brother a lot more poorly now. And so we have to deal with that. And so the feeling inside of me is a kind of protective jealousy, I think, of, like, oh, no, dude, he's going to be exposed to something that's going to, I think, you know, chip away at his character and actually make him a less generous person. That's the kind of passion. And it's not about me as such. Like, he must be raised in my home and have my values.

But even in the midst of God's judgment, he knows that God has a soft spot for people who turn to him in humility. I think this is why he told Jeremiah not to pray for the people. It's the Same idea.

And what should come is in loyal love, covenant love. But what he says is great in power. And then he adds from verse 7 of Exodus 34, the Lord won't declare innocent the guilty, or he won't leave guilty the unpunished. So what's interesting about that is to say that he's great in loyal love. That's a covenant term. He's going to stick by his covenant. Well, Yahweh is not in a covenant with the nation of Assyria.",

You know, God's reached the limit of his patience. And that's what this poem is emphasizing. So I don't know if this makes you squirm. It should.

If you look through these 27 that I have, and I think there's a few more. The vast majority quote from verse six from, like, the goody parts that we like. The most consistent way these verses are quoted is people in trouble, people sitting in a mess of their own making, and they turn back to God and say, let's go back to God, because Exodus 34, 6, he's this way. And that kind of makes sense because that's a big part of what they mean, and that's a part of the original context of the story that these verses appear in. But verse seven is just as important of a statement about God's character. But I think we've touched on it. It's a promise of stability, of a predictability in God's response. He's merciful and he's just. Which. Even verse seven, which is intense, brings a degree of assurance that I always know where I stand with Yahweh based on my own behavior and choices. I don't have to wonder. And that he's going to be like this always for every generation, not like change from generation to generation. I think those are significant takeaways.",

My favorite thing about the Bible Project is how it exposes the beautiful story which leads to the Messiah. Once you're exposed to so much beauty, you're gonna get addicted. And the Bible Project has helped me fall in love with the Bible to the point where I'm reading it all the time. We believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus. We're a crowdfunded project by people like me. Find free videos, study notes, podcast, podcasts, classes, and more@thebibleproject.com what do you think, Luna?",
