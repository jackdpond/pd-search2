In a really important passage in Exodus 34. Last week we looked at the first word he used to describe himself, that he's compassionate. And this week we're going to look at the second word that God is, gracious. Now, when we call someone gracious, we often mean something like courteous, like she was gracious with that stranger.

But anyway, my point is that this word gracious, both in Hebrew and in its Greek translation, have made their way into the English language through names.

So it can describe somebody's character. Gracious. It can also describe how something is perceived as being elegant or charming or graceful. That's really interesting.

It is the gift of God that no one should boast that's from Ephesians 2, but that all those ideas about salvation by grace are rooted in the use of this word and concept for God's character in the Hebrew Bible.

Okay, so these are words where gracious or grace is used in a relational sense. It's something that one person gives to another or that one person does to another. And most often it describes actions that display generosity. Gift giving or favor is how the English translations throughout history have rendered it. So, for example, in the Book of Esther, there's multiple times where people are coming before a king to seek Chen from him. It's a verb used in a request form to get his chin. And so usually it gets translated to seek favor or request favor. So for Esther, all of the Jewish people in the city of Susa are going to be killed.

I'm not inclined to view this with Chayn. Right, right. The king allowed these people to be killed, but yet she's going to ask him for chain anyway.

Now, you could just think he's good at his job. And Potiphar gets pleasure from by walking, watching Joseph do a good job. But then Potiphar looking. Right. Having eyes that see khen in Joseph generates a response of Chen. He makes Joseph his personal attendant. He appoints him over his whole house.

And so to find chin in the eyes of someone means that you're being given a gift of generosity, kindness by someone who you don't properly deserve it or don't necessarily merit it. It's a gift.

But we're told verse eight, Noah found ch in the eyes of Yahweh. The eyes of Yahweh see lots of badness, but then they find one. One person, and that person generates hen in the eyes of God. And the next thing he says is build narc as a result. So what this sets you up to see, then, is that the providing of the ark and the means of escape is an act of God's graciousness.

Because if people see them showing a Favor back to me that will increase my honor in everyone's eyes. So a lot of the vocabulary of glory or honor in the Bible is all kind of shaped in the storyline for many, many cultures to show favor, generosity to someone of lower social rank or who doesn't deserve it could be really foolish. Yeah, the Greek philosophers wrote whole training manuals for teaching young Greek and Roman men who to pick as the recipients of your favor. It was really important to learn how to discriminate. And so this is why God's grace in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus was so scandalous to Paul, because it was given to people like him who was trying to murder the Messiah or the followers of the Messiah, and yet God gave him the gift of grace anyway.",

It's a pattern that God is continually more patient, more generous with people than they deserve. And so that's why we're making the golden calf story. That Exodus 3, 4, 6 becomes another iconic narrative of that. And then that moment of asking God for grace, show grace to me. It's repeated so many times. I have all these psalms posted here in the notes. Psalm 4. Be gracious to me when I am in distress. Psalm 6. Be gracious to me, O Lord. I'm languishing, my bones are troubled. I like that. Psalm 25, turn to me. Be gracious to me. I'm lonely and afflicted. But then the. You could say the more scandalous acts of grace are like Psalm 51, when David, after raping a woman and killing her husband, says, be gracious to me according to your loyal. Ooh.

This concept of Jesus as the expression of God's grace is explicitly picked up on in the introduction to the Gospel of John. We may have mentioned this, that Exodus 34:6 is quoted explicitly one time in the New Testament and it's in the prologue to John. And so when John says that the Word, the pre incarnate Jesus, this is verse 14 of chapter one of John, when the Word became flesh and set up a tent, a tabernacle among us. And we saw his glory, the glory as of the only, the one and only from the Father. So when he talks about we saw his glory, he's echoing the story of Moses seeing God's glory on Mount Sinai. So God's glory on Mount Sinai became human and set up a tabernacle among us. And that one he says is full of grace and truth.

The Father has been giving grace overabundantly, just overflowing with it. Everybody has received is a recipient of God's grace, whether they know it or not. Grace upon grace.
