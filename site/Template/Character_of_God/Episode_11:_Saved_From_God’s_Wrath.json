We've done these past six episodes on this one attribute of God because for many of us God's anger can be scary and confusing. For others, we've actually flattened out God's anger to be something simpler than what it actually is.",

You've done wrong, you've sinned. God is holy, therefore he is angry at you for your sin and he's going to kill you. It's his justice and his holiness. He has to kill you. Jesus died in your place instead. And so you can be forgiven and have life instead of death. So what I'm saying is that abstraction doesn't really do justice to all of the elements in that summary, especially this idea of God's anger and death. God's anger is God's handing people over to a process that's self chosen that results in death. But it's very much what I want.",

    "text": "So the fact is, is that the portrait of God's anger is way more nuanced than that. And it's actually telling us some really powerful things that we stand to benefit and learn from about ourselves and about God. God's anger doesn't occur nearly as often as readers of the Old Testament might think. It occurs less often in the Bible. And when it does occur, it's surprising. So God's anger appears first in the Bible with Moses in a conversation that he's having about how he wants Moses to represent him. And Moses refuses five times over. That's the first time God gets angry. So that itself is beginning a pattern that God's anger in the Old Testament is most consistently expressed towards the people that he's calling to represent him. And the famous stories like the Flood or Sodom and Gomorrah, they are acts of God's justice against evil. But in neither one of those stories is God angry. In the Flood, God is overcome with grief and sorrow. So as the storyline of the Bible develops, God invests in one particular group of people to be his representatives to the world. And they are the ones with whom God gets most angry most often in the storyline of the Bible. Just like how we tend to get the most angry and frustrated with the people that we are most invested in relationally. If you search, get a concordance, and you search out all the times that God gets angry at Israel, you'll find a few dozen stories and you'll find a pretty consistent response. How does God express his anger? And it's most consistently demonstrated with the phrase, and God handed them over or gave them over into the hands of their enemies. So God hands Israel over to the consequences that are destructive and ruinous. But it's the choices that they made that got them there. Moses says it's God hiding his face. And the prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, they developed this in a big way. And the bad guys that Israel's handed over to because of their faithlessness to the covenant is Assyria and Babylon. Assyria, we didn't talk about this. Isaiah calls Syria the rod of God's anger. It's as if Assyria is the instrument of God's anger, which is to hand Israel over to their bad decisions. So when Jesus enters the scene, he sees himself in the role of another one of these prophets, but also as the covenant God of Israel himself, pursuing his people again, warning them that if they don't accept his way of being Israel among the nations, that they are going to yet again be subject to God's anger, which will be to be handed over to the power of Rome. Jesus warned that this would happen. And when he rode into Jerusalem for Passover, he intentionally provoked the rulers of Jerusalem, challenging their authority, claiming that he was Israel's true authority. And when he began to talk about what he thought was going to happen, it becomes clear that he knew that he was going to die. In fact, he went to Jerusalem specifically to poke the bear, to provoke the leaders to a showdown, knowing that they would kill him. But it's not a tragedy in Jesus eyes. In Jesus eyes, he is, and he uses this phrase multiple times in that Passover week, that he's going to drink the cup of God's anger, which is the key prophetic image for being Israel being handed over to pagan oppressors, to foreign. Foreign armies.",

Yes, I think that if you just study the scriptural hyperlinks that Jesus is making there, I think that's unavoidably the conclusion. And that's precisely what he goes to Jerusalem to do. And that's why he stages his protest in the temple courts in full view of the leaders of the temple, but also in view of the Roman governor, because the Roman governor had a vested interest in keeping the peace in the temple courts. So Jesus trial. The moment of these two Jesuses standing on trial. An innocent Jesus, son of God, and then a guilty Jesus, Barabbas, who's a rebel against Rome, and the innocent Jesus who was trying to tell Israel to love their Roman enemies. And then the guilty Jesus who tried to kill the Roman enemies go free. And Jesus intentionally goes to his death on behalf of his guilty people. And this is what he meant by drinking the cup of God's anger. The anger there is simultaneously the wrath of Rome and the wrath of Israel's leaders. Another important strand in here is Jesus's understanding of his death and confrontation as being a cosmic confrontation with demonic spiritual powers that have hijacked the kingdoms of this world to be instruments of injustice as opposed to justice. And he believes that's what he's confronting, the powers of darkness. So it's substitutionary atonement. It's Jesus dying in our place. It's Jesus conquering the powers of death and evil in our place. And it's Jesus as an act of love and surrender, giving his life in the place of faithless, corrupt people. It's all of those things rushing together. So anger is one sub theme of them. That took me a while. Sorry.",

    "text": "So I've excerpted here a selection from Romans, Chapter one. I'll just kind of read us through and be a play tour guide as we. As we go through. But you'll just kind of. Let's just follow Paul's thought here. He's just told them. Paul's writing a letter to a network of house churches in Rome that are divided along ethnic and culture lines. And he's trying to help them see that they should be unified because he wants to go there and use their network as a home base to go be a missionary further on into Spain. And he wants to announce the gospel, the good news. And so he unpacks what that is. He says in chapter one, verse 16, I am not ashamed of the good News. It is God's power for rescuing everyone who believes to the Jew first, but also to the Greek, for in the good news. God's righteousness, the upstanding character of God that compels him to do right by his promises. That's what is revealed in the good news. That's my paraphrase. That's not actually what the translation says. That was my paraphrase. It's revealed from faith to faith. There's literally whole stacks of books written on just what that phrase means, just as it is written. And he quotes Habakkuk, chapter two, the righteous one, the one who does right by God will live by his trust, his faith in God. So the righteousness of God is revealed in the good news. And then he flips it. He says, because the wrath of God, the anger of God is being revealed from the skies against all ungodliness, all unrighteousness of people who suppress the truth in unrighteousness. He unpacks it. He says, because what is known about God is evident even inside of people. God has made it evident to them since the creation of the world. God's invisible attributes, his power, his nature, you can see them being understood by what's been made.",

His point is, even without having the special privilege of Israel watching the 10 plagues and the rescue of the Exodus and being at Mount Sinai, you can just do a Psalm 19, you know, the heavens, declare your glory. You look up and you'd be like, someone's behind this whole elaborate cosmic system. Yep, that's his point. So he says even though humans can infer that there is some beautiful mind behind the whole thing, even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks. Rather, they became futile or pointless in their speculations and their foolish hearts were darkened. How does that work? Well, thinking that they were all wise, they became fools. And humans exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible humans, birds, four footed animals and crawling creatures. So for modern readers, this doesn't land nearly the way it would for somebody who lives in the first century Rome, which is where these people lived, where you had idol shrines at every corner and even in the corners of most people's houses.",

And then there's all of the classic kind of Greek gods or Zeus or Apollo, but they all embody war, justice, wine, the economy. They're what today we would call institutions. Actually, you know, when I lived in Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, where I was going to graduate school, it's also the state capitol. And the state capitol building is like right next to the big university. So I went in there quite a bit. And I went to Oregon State Capitol where I grew up like once on a field trip for school or something. But I went into the Wisconsin State Capitol a lot. And if you look up is all of these elaborate decorative carvings and there's all these great words like liberty and justice, but written in Roman capital letters like Latin capital letters. And above them are statues of the Greek or Roman gods that these words represented. And I remember it hit me one day like, oh, I'm not as far from the first century as I thought.

And you pointed out, pointed this out many times, is that the tragedy here is not merely the turning away from God and creating an idol to represent him. It's that we're missing that we're supposed to be the image of God. So there's this calling of reflecting the true nature of this. And he uses the word incorruptible. I'd be curious why that word.

That was a really cool conversation. But what she was pointing out is if you. This is the first occurrence of the word glory. If you trace it through what it most often refers to is the glorious status that God made humans for. So to exchange the glory of the incorruptible God is to exchange the glory that the incorruptible God wants us to have. That's what it means here.

Even in the letter to the Romans, when Paul brings up God's anger, the first story he starts thinking in terms of is the Golden Calf story. And in light of the Genesis 1 image of God story. So, yeah, and here it's. Yeah, you're right, it's not even betrayal as such. It's the thing that God so passionately invested in to share this world with human partners, ruling it together. And that's the thing that we forfeit when we take these transcendent ideals of beauty and goodness and justice and these wonderful gifts of sex and food and power, and then we treat them as gods that we're willing to give everything for. And that's the moment that God gets angry. That's Paul's argument in a nutshell here. So then that raises the question, well, how is the wrath of God being revealed? What does it look like? If you wanted to know where to look for it? If God's angry, what would you see? And he repeats himself three times. What he thinks it means starts in verse 24. He says, therefore, because they've exchanged their glory that God wants them to have for idolatry, therefore God gave them over in the passionate desires of their hearts to impurity so that their bodies would be dishonored. And he goes on to talk about all these destructive sexual misbehaviors that hurt people and through which people hurt others and themselves. Verse 26, he repeats it again. For this reason, God gave them over to dishonoring or degrading passions. Verse 28, skipping forward again. And just as they didn't see fit to even acknowledge God anymore, God gave them over to a senseless mind so that they would do things that are not right. He begins to go through this bucket list here that he uses to describe the culture that he sees around him. Unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossip. It's basically any human community anywhere in the history of the world. And verse 32, even though people know that these things are wrong, and if they believe in God as he says, even though they know God's commands, they know that people who practice such things are worthy of death. But yeah, we do them anyway and we even approve of people who do these things, he's trying to give a portrait of a realistic portrait of what happens to human communities when they exalt Idolatrous ideals and self made ideals and gods up to the place of God. He gives people over. He said it three times. And God's anger is giving people over to the consequences of their decisions. So there's a lot more going on in Romans 1. I just wanted to point that out that this is exactly how the Hebrew Bible talks about God saying, handing them over. Paul's articulating it just like they do.",

That's what Paul is certainly trying to say here. SA can't quote Romans without quoting one of the great Romans commentators of our day, NT Wright. He's got a great way of putting this.

If the 20th century isn't a total affront to God's goodness, he goes on, Paul's whole theology is grounded in the robust scripturally rooted view that the Creator is neither a tyrant nor an absentee landlord, but rather the creator and lover of the world. The result is God's wrath. Not just an attitude of hostility towards idolatry and immorality, but also actions that follow from that attitude. The content of God's wrath involves the process of giving people over to the result of their own folly, but also more, those consequences are also in anticipation of a final judgment. The death that Paul mentions in verse 32 of chapter 1. In other words, what he's saying is God handing people over three times over. And it all leads up to the climax of the chapter in verse 32 there, which is death. It's all one organically connected whole. Yeah, those two, the handing over and the ending in death are connected organically. The moral degradation in the present is an anticipation of the ultimate degrading of humanness itself, that is death. I just thought that's a good way to put that. We see them as separate things.

    "text": "So my main point bringing this up is to say, here's the apostle Paul. This is the most elaborate description of God's anger that we have in the letters of the apostles. And once again, it's really nuanced and I think it's profound and it's not quite what you might first think when you think of God's anger in the Bible. So Paul's creating a problem here in chapter one, and he goes on to talk in great detail and through long, complex lines of argument about what God is doing about all this. I just want to hit his Kind of recap of this in chapter five. And we'll just start in verse six. You know, reading Paul anymore is impossible. When you can't sit down and just read the whole thing, the whole letter, because this is hopelessly out of context. But it's like we don't have time to talk about the whole thing. But starting in verse six, where he says, these are well known lines, he says, you know, at just the right time, when we all were still weak or powerless, the Messiah died for those who are ungodly. Then he steps back to reflect and he says, you know, it's interesting. It's very rare that anyone would go die in the place of a righteous person. Though maybe for a really good person, someone might dare to die. There's a New Testament scholar, Simon Gathercole, who's written on this little line. He thinks Paul is alluding to some of the famous Greek epic stories of the noble death of the soldier who will die for his army general or this kind of thing. And he's playing into that category of like, you know, we have this category of the noble death. But somebody who would die for their enemies, die for weak, powerless, sinful people, that's crazy. And that's what the Messiah did. So then verse 8. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this, while we were the ones in the wrong. That's when the Messiah died for us. So he's inverting the noble death theme here. You might die for your leader or for your friend, but to die for someone who can benefit you in no way, and who's betrayed you and who's betrayed you. Yes. So this passage is important. Well, I'll just keep reading it and then we'll come back and talk about it. It's important. Next statement is, therefore, since we have been justified, it's the NIV translation. You could kind of infer what he means by that. Since we have been declared to be right in right relationship with God by his blood, that is, by Jesus sacrificial death, how much more will we be saved from God's wrath through him? For if, while we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his son, how much more, after we've been reconciled, will we be saved through his life? And not only this, but we can actually boast, we can speak publicly about how God has given us honor through Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received reconciliation. In other words, to be someone for whom the Messiah died isn't to stay cowering in the dust and be like, oh, that God would put up with me. Terrible me. He says, it's something you can boast about. You can go out in public and say, yeah, like, that guy built a coliseum. She built a library. And that's a testament to her honor. You know what I boast in the Messiah of Israel gave his life for me, and that's what gives me honor. Dude, Paul. Dude. It's so good he's working all these themes. This is a great passage. My point to bring it up here is when Paul, in verse 8 of chapter 5 of Romans, when he talks about the cross, what he foregrounds of God's character is not his anger. He foregrounds God's love. The cross is a demonstration of God's love. In the next sentence, he does say that it's by Jesus death that we are delivered, rescued from God's wrath through him. So what many people take that to mean is the. Oh, yes, God was going to kill me, but instead he killed Jesus and he wants to forgive me. And so what we have to do is upload what Paul means by God's anger and wrath from chapter one.",

It's God being angry that his human, royal human images hand over their destiny and glory to created things rather than the Creator. And so he gives them over on a path that leads to death.

    "text": "I think for me, the enduring takeaway from spending so much time thinking about this is seeing God's what feel like more unpleasant sides of his character. Anger, judgment. But I think I am more. I'm a step closer to seeing how those are expressions of his deep, agonizing love for creation and how often the discomfort I have with God's anger is really some way that I'm shielding myself from hypocrisy. Because if I'm impatient or uncomfortable with God getting angry or bringing justice on somebody else. The thing is, I'm quite happy when God agrees with who I think ought to be judged. But when I participate in or am complicit in personal ways or corporate ways that hurt other people, I'm really hoping that he'll be patient and slow to anger with me and show me love. I don't know, man. The Bible has a much more profound and powerful way of reflecting on God's character, his anger and his love than normally we tend to think. And it makes more sense to me than ever. Why? The Bible is a book that requires a lifetime of meditation to really experience the character, the character of God.",

The Holiness has a huge place in the Bible and it was important for me to get a meaning. I use Bible Project to understand better things in the Word of God in order to understand better the one who loved me first. My favorite things about Bible Projects are that it is very reachable and it makes easy to understand. Thanks to the voice over and images we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus. We are a crowdfunded project by people like me. Find free videos, study notes, podcasts, classes and more@bibleproject.com.",
