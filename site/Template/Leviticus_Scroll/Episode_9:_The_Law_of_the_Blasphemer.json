    "text": "So maybe one more time I'll just do a quick overview of the book. So Leviticus, it's the center scroll of the five scrolls of the Torah. But even within the shape of the five scrolls, you have Genesis and Deuteronomy as the outer bookend, so to speak. And inside of that is three scrolls that really link together in an important sequence. Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers. And Leviticus is the heart of that central set of stories. So God is on a mission to find a human partner to rule heaven and earth with so that God's image and character can be displayed to the nations of the earth through a human partner. And so at this point in the story, God has chosen the nation of Israel, entered into a covenant partnership with them in Mount Sinai. And then once the people said, yes, double thumbs up, we want to partner with Yahweh, then God says, great, let's move in. And so he has a special sacred tent constructed, and he comes to live among his people. And that's how the book of Leviticus begins, with the crisis of God coming to live among his people. You thought it was great, and it is great, but it is also dangerous, which is why Moses can't go in at the end of Exodus. So God, in the first movement of Leviticus, provided a way for his people to come near through sacrifices and offerings. That's chapters one through seven. And then once his people do come near, the second movement of Leviticus, chapters eight through 16, God appoints and ordains Israel's priests, a subset within Israel, come near on behalf of the nation. And on the first day on the Job, two of the priests. Priests just blow it big time. And they do what Yahweh has not commanded them to do. So they die. Those two priests die on the spot on day one. Bummer. And that creates another crisis, that there's death, dead bodies introduced into the very hot spot of the source of life. And so God tells Aaron and the remaining sons to stop drinking before they come into the tent, so that they have a sober mind of wisdom to teach Israel the difference between holy and common, between purity and impurity. Then purity and impurity sets the tone for the rest of chapters 11 through 16 leading up to the Day of Atonement, when Israel's impurities are dealt with.",

And so that leaves for this last part of the book, now that the way of Yahweh has been opened back up again to live among his people, even though they're impure and morally compromised, he wants to live in their midst. The Day of atonement and all the offerings make that possible. So now that Yahweh comes to live among his people, what's the goal? The goal is that the tent facilitates a meeting between Yahweh and his people so that they can become more and more holy and set apart and more faithful images of God's character in the world. And so we looked at the laws given for the holiness of the people, and we also looked at the way Sabbath and the structures of time and the liturgy of time in Israel was all designed to make them people whose whole lives are oriented around the way of the Lord. And that's the section of the book that we're in near the end here. How was that?",

And you're like, hooray. I mean, we're not back in Eden, but we've got a little Eden outpost among the people. If they live this way, this is great. What could go wrong?

A Hebrew Bible scholar, Tamar Kamiankowski, who's written a lot on the section of Leviticus in her academic work, and she has this little article on this story. So she makes the argument that in this section of the book, the holy name of Yahweh that is on the people, that sets them apart among the nations, is the holy sacred object that's available to any Israelite. They carry the name as a people, and they can, through their actions with each other, defile the name or profane it by how you treat, you know, your neighbor. And so it's analogous. What the name is to your average Israelite is the same as what the tent is to the priests. And so she makes this argument that this image of piercing the name and so defiling it is being set on analogy to the sons of Aaron who inappropriately pierced through the curtains and went into the tent unauthorized and violating the command of Yahweh and so died. Because what's interesting is there's three stories linked together by the vocabulary of this. So one is, everybody lays their hands on this guy's head and takes him outside the camp the day of atonement. And that's the language used of the goat sent away to Azazel in the wilderness, where they lay the sins upon him and exile him. That was also first used of the two sons of Aaron who inappropriately barged into the tent. They were killed, and then their dead bodies were taken outside the Camp. So you have this portrait here of people who dishonor the sacred gift of Yahweh's person and presence and name in their midst. It's like you're sawing off the branch that you're sitting on as an Israelite. It's Yahweh's name and holiness that is keeping you all alive out here in the desert. And you're going to profane the name or curse the name. Now, the story's not done yet. This gets even more actually complicated and interesting. If you want to keep going down.",

So what's interesting is after this death sentence that's issued for the name cursor, then there's another little legal paragraph here that's set as an analogy, almost like a little parable. And it goes like this. If a human takes the life of any other human being, they will be put to death. That's the life for life rule of retribution in ancient Israel.

The people who are signed up to be the priests have to do it. Right. Still, that's hard. But the second way that helps me with it is that it's a reflection on what it's like for the image of God to go rogue, choose to take the forbidden fruit.

That is a contraction of the portal that minimizes the holiness of the community and God's ability to make them holy. So those contractions, the profaning of the Name, it strains the divine human relationship, impacting both partners.

And so this is an aspect where this is how God relates to his unique elect covenant partners who have been liberated, who have been given Eden in the wilderness. And if they turn on him, then out of all of the nations there, they are more culpable than any other nation. The Sabbath principle of abundance will invert into a Sabbath principle of curse. We just have to sit with that. That's the message of this section of the book. I'm not sure what to say. It makes me uncomfortable too. But at the same time, this is a part of the Hebrew Bible's portrait that's trying to say, even when God selected One nation out of the many and did so much for them.

And you know, there might be some of you who are left over as a remnant. It's verse 36. Let's say there's a remnant left over after the flood of God's justice and wiping clear of the land. And they are living in the land of their enemies, and they're terrified and they're afraid. But verse 40, if they confess their wrongdoing, if they confess the sins of their ancestors, their unfaithfulness that they committed against me, and the hostility that they acted against me. If they humble their uncircumcised hearts and make amends for their iniquity, then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, my covenant with Isaac, my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. The land will be abandoned by them. It'll make up for those Sabbaths. And in spite of this, when they're in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, but I'll remember my covenant. That's how this chapter ends. So it ends with a little ski Jump. It's not a full promise of restoration. What it is is that if they humble themselves, if even just a remnant is out there floating on the sea of exile in their little ark, calling out to me, humbling themselves, then I will remember them. That's the same phrase of what God does to Noah when he sees them floating in the boat. God remembered Noah and then brought about a new creation for him to inhabit. And that's how this chapter ends, too. So notice how the themes of Sabbath, the name of Yahweh, honoring the name, the cycles of seven, they're all brought together here.

And so In Galatians chapter three, he says, Listen, as many. This is Galatians 3:10. As many Israelites as lived under the works of the Torah, they were under a curse. Just as it was written. Cursed is everyone who doesn't live by all the things written in this book of the Torah to do them. Quoting Deuteronomy.",

And it's not that the laws of the Torah were bad. It's that humans prove themselves unable to live by the will in the word of God. And so what he talks about is how the Messiah redeemed us, redeemed Israel from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it's written, cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree. The way Paul sees it is that all of the covenant curses that were for Israel were like focused in, like through a magnifying glass in on Israel's Messiah on the cross. And so Jesus suffered. He sees the suffering and death of Jesus as the culminating final act and exhausting the power of the covenant curses. Of the Torah that they no longer have a hold over those who are in the Messiah. So you can read Romans 7 and 8 and he articulates the same point of view. So I think that's how Jesus and the apostles would read this, is that Jesus finished, exhausted the powers of the covenant curse so that the blessing can be released for the nations. Or as Jesus says that a Messiah, an anointed representative, would go into suffering and death and be exalted to glory on the other side so that forgiveness could be announced in his name to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem, which is essentially an outline of what I mean is what he says the Hebrew Bible is all about. And Leviticus plays a key role in that. So, yeah, I don't think I should be afraid of being cursed by God if I'm a follower of Jesus. Like, Jesus shouldered that on my behalf. That's what he did for me. So I read this as wisdom, though, because it becomes a case study in human nature. And I'm a human.",

Hi, this is Keith and I'm from from London, Ontario in Canada. I first heard about bibleproject a few years back when my church was going through the Book of Romans. I first heard about BibleProject from Crew, my campus's Christian ministry group. I use BibleProject for helping my personal studies in the Bible. I use bibleproject for the first time that I read the Bible front to back. My favorite thing about bibleproject is all the videos of themes and the things that run throughout the Bible.",
