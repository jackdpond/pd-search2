That's atonement. They begin to surrender themselves and all Israel to God through sacrifices and offerings. But then the two sons of Aaron decide, with poor judgment, that they want to rewrite the liturgy that they were just told to obey. Exactly. And so they take the place of their dad by offering unauthorized fire inside the tent, which is only for their dad to do right now. And they do it.

That has been brought into proximity or dedicated to the service of the God of Israel, who's the creator of heaven and earth, who is called throughout the Hebrew Bible as the Holy one, or in the book of Isaiah, the holy, Holy, holy one, triple holy, the most holy one. So holiness refers to the unique, one of a kind, status of the one God of Israel, who it is claimed is the source of all life, being, goodness, beauty, light, the source of the I am. The I am. Exactly. And so their holiness refers to the unique one of a kind, holy other above and beyond status of I am. But here's the thing that's also unique about this portrait of the God of the Bible is that this is a God who is so generous, that wants to share being and existence and light and goodness and beauty with one who is other than God's own self. And this is the concept of creation in the biblical story. And so God creates an other who can exist in limited autonomy and freedom to just be. But that being is an invitation to become connected to the source in the relationship.",

There's a law in the Book of Numbers that says before Israel set out in its wilderness journeys, they made sure to get anybody who had the skin disease or had touched a dead body, were in pure fluids in the last seven days, and they had to go to the border of the camp. They couldn't travel inside the camp itself. They had to go behind. And that was their way of honoring this. That when Yahweh is in our midst, we remove whatever is associated with death to be far away from the hotspot of the source of all life. So to be in an impure state is not morally wrong, but it is a sign that I am cut off from the source. I'm far as far from life as you can be. And so to enter into a pure state is to go one step closer to being fit to be in the holy presence. And it means that I'm restored to a status of health and life. But to be pure doesn't mean you're in the holy place. It means that you can now go into the holy place if you want to. And then that to go from a pure state to entering into the holy place, that becomes sanctification or consecration. So here's our spectrum. You go from being impure to becoming pure. And then once you're pure, you're eligible to become holy. But holiness and purity are not the same thing.",

So when people come into contact with the holy foods of the temple, that holiness gets transferred to them. But, you know, could be dangerous, for example. But being in a pure state is not contagious. When you're in a pure state, you could either get leveled up to holiness by contacting it, or you can get leveled away from holiness towards impurity by touching it. And so impurity and holiness are the two contagious states. So what is fascinating, and here just this is a good. Like, get your friends together on a Friday night and read the Gospel of Luke out loud. And you just watch. Luke has intentionally placed in all of his healing narratives the people who would be populating the list of Leviticus 11 through 15. Uniquely, Jesus touches dead bodies. He touches people. A woman leaking menstrual blood. He touches people with skin diseases. He goes into the homes of non Israelites who would not be eating kosher. It's truly remarkable. Luke has intentionally shown Jesus as the Holy One of God, which he's called in Luke Acts, he's called the Holy One of God, and he is God's contagious holiness. Moving out one by one. Just checking off the list of people from Leviticus 11:15.",

But in the case of Jesus, his contagious holiness actually transforms them. It turns the impure thing into pure, which makes them fit for the presence of God. So this is a cool way how these chapters might seem so extreme and bizarre, but they actually illuminate how Jesus saw the world and why he moved towards the kinds of people that he did. It's because he knew these chapters well and they informed his view of the world, and he didn't think they were bad. Jesus didn't overturn these systems, but what he did was use his holy power to bring people into a state of purity, to bring them into proximity to holiness. So that's a cool way that these connect to Jesus. These chapters in Leviticus are a part of the unified story that leads to Jesus.",
