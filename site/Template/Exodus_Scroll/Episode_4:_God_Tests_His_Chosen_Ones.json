So Elohim took the people by the way of the wilderness of the sea and reeds. By 50s, the sons of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt. Now, this is a good example. I'll just highlight it here. This is a good example of the patterning for how biblical authors organize literary Movements. Everything that I just read is in exactly the same words, the things that Pharaoh was afraid would happen if he let the people be fruitful and multiply at the very beginning of the first paragraph of the Exodus story. So in chapter one, what Pharaoh says is, look, the people, the sons of Israel, are great and more mighty than me. So come, let's deal wisely with them so that they don't be fruitful and multiply. Because what if war happens? They will add themselves to our enemies, and they will make war against us and go up out of the land. So he says, I've got an idea. Let's enslave them. And then what happens is Yahweh makes war on them, and they are fruitful and multiply, and they go up out of the land.

Bibleproject is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus. Everything that we make is free because of the support of thousands of people just like you. So thank you so much for being a part of this with us. Hi, this is Rainbow Liao and I'm from Taiwan. I first heard about Bibleproject from YouTube. I use Bibleproject for a panoramic view of each book. My favorite thing is the lively animations and concise interpretation. We believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus. We're a crowdfunded project by people like me. Find free videos, study notes, podcasts, classes and more@bibleproject.com.",
