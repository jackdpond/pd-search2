    "text": "I'm John Collins. This is BibleProject podcast. And today Tim Mackey and I get to talk with our friend and Hebrew Bible scholar, Dr. Carmen Imes. Carmen has been on the podcast before, talking about her book Bearing God's why Sinai Still Matters. Because she's a good friend of ours and because she has an emphasis on the scroll of Exodus in her studies, we thought, how great would it be to sit down with her at the end of our journey through Exodus and debrief a bit about the things we've been talking about. It was wonderful to talk with Carmen, but it was also a little discombobulating, actually, because Carmen presents a few alternative interpretations to stories that we've been reading. Namely the story in Exodus 19 where Israel comes to the base of Mount Sinai. God asks them to become ritually pure and prepare themselves to make a covenant with him. As Tim and I talked through that story, Tim made a compelling case for how Israel was meant to go up the mountain. When the trumpets blast. And when they don't go up the mountain, they've failed a test. They failed to trust God. But Carmen is going to give us an alternative perspective on this story in which Israel was never meant to go up the mountain. And. And they passed the test by fearing God and staying at the base of the mountain and sending Moses up instead as an intercessor. And so, as we listen along as two Hebrew Bible scholars discuss a passage in the Bible and come to fundamentally two different perspectives on what it means, if you're like me, you might get a little flustered, but it's also good to remember that the Bible is meant to be read in community and were meant to challenge each other.",

So they watch them outside of class. You guys kept making so many videos. I used to show them in class, but then there were so many that, like, there was no time left for me to talk. And so now I've created an outside of the class dimension where they watch them and take quizzes on our learning management platform. And it's the consistently their favorite thing about the class is that they, they love engaging visually with the text. So that's fun. I am associate professor of Old Testament at Biola University.

So maybe kind of wrap that together. That's where we are. Let's, for this conversation, we're parked at the foot of Mount Sinai. So talk about those first paragraphs and moments of the story, how that connects to one of the Ten Commandments, and just talk about that.",

So I've really been in these chapters for 10 years now and just think they're fantastic. And I really believe that if we want to understand our identity and vocation as believers, we have to go back to Sinai, because this is where it really is fleshed out. So, yeah, the people arrive at Sinai in Exodus chapter 19. They've crossed through the desert, and the first thing that happens is God speaks to them through Moses. And in Exodus 19, verse 3, he says, this is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel. You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and, and how I carried you on eagle's wings and brought you to myself. Now, if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations, you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. And those. That moment is so important in Israel's development as a nation because it's defining who they are and what they are designed to do. What is the vocation that God has for them. And that phrase, my favorite phrase, phrase, there is treasured possession, which is just one word in Hebrew, the word segola. And segola is not just a warm, fuzzy term that you might use if you really like somebody. It's a technical term used in treaty context to indicate a special treaty partner that has a representative role. And so God is appointing Israel to a special task of representing him among the nations. And that's before they get the law. It's, you know, the second half of Exodus is known for having lots of laws. Before we even get to that, God makes clear, this is who you are. You as a nation are holy. You're set apart for my service. You represent me among the nations.",

Okay, so let's talk about how that connects to this language of kingdom of priests, and then also about carrying the name, I think, because then that tees us up for what we would like to do with you, which is actually to kind of walk through the steps of this narrative of how God shows up on the mountain and then how they come up to the mountain and then are they supposed to go up it? But only Moses does. So there's things we'll talk about there. But all the way back here, just this is setting out the ideal picture, as it were.",

  {
    "text": "Yeah, yeah. So he. So he calls them his treasured possession, kingdom of priests. And that's before he's given them any laws. But then he does give them laws. And those laws are the means by which they carry out the mission. He's just given them to be the treasured possession, the Sega and the kingdom of priests. So why is kingdom of priests important? Well, it's very interesting that God would designate an entire nation as having some sort of priestly status. This would be totally unique in the ancient world. The idea that everyone in this nation is a priest or that together they function in priestly ways. And so in just a few chapters, we'll meet the actual, the people who are designated priests in Israel's Tabernacle, Aaron and his sons. And we'll see that they are. They become like a visual model of what the entire nation is supposed to be and do. And so the high priest in particular is interesting to watch because he's the best dressed Israelite. He has this elaborate costume that he wears, made with gold and jewels and fancy dyed fabrics and embroidered fabrics. And we're told in chapter 28, Exodus, chapter 28 is where God gives Moses the instructions for how to make his garments. And we're told that he's supposed to bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart. So He's. He's got 12 gemstones on his chest. Each gemstone corresponds to one of the 12 tribes. As you know, there are actually 13 tribes. We don't count Levi in this because he himself is a Levite. So I presume the 12 stones are the 12 other tribes. But anyway, he is bearing their names. He represents them before Yahweh. And then he also wears some kind of golden medallion on his forehead. And that medallion is engraved in Hebrew with two words, Kadosh la Yahweh. And it's wholly belonging to Yahweh is the. The meaning of it. So it's setting him apart as somebody who's designated by Yahweh for this special task. So with that in mind, like we can then circle back to they're the kingdom of priests. If the priests, high priest is representing them between. He stands between Yahweh and the rest of the nation as a representative, then they as a nation are in a sense standing between Yahweh and the rest of the nations, the rest of the world, and having that kind of media oral role. And presumably they have this. Well, not presumably, God tells them they have this representative role. And so it's as if they are wearing God's name too. And so when we get to the Ten Commandments and God says, you shall not bear the name of Yahweh, your God in vain, which is what it actually says in Hebrew. Bear the name Nassah using the same Hebrew word that's used to describe what the high priest is doing with names on his chest. He's NASA ing the names and they are supposed to bear the name of Yahweh. It seems clear to me that that command is not prohibiting them from saying God's name or from using it as a swear word or using it in oaths. Although we have to think carefully about how we speak God's name. The command is much broader than that. It's telling them, you are my representatives. I've put my name on you, so represent me well.",

And Moses is failing to trust him for it because he says in chapter 4, verse 14, then the Lord's anger burned against Moses, and he said, what about your brother Aaron? The Levite I know he can speak. Well, he is already on his way to meet you. And I think one way to read that is God already had this covered. And it's the reason God's angry is not that he needs to call Aaron. He had already called Aaron. But Moses is the one who's failing to trust that God's going to work this out and give him what he needs.",

The Lord said to him, who gave human beings their mouths, who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I? The Lord, like God, knows Moses intimately and knows what sort of support he's going to need. The problem is that Moses doubts his own ability and needs to trust.

But when we're at Mount Sinai, I appreciate your perspective that to be a kingdom of priests is not at odds with having a priestly tribe with high priests, that those can all work in sync together. So let's move on to kind of the next step in this story then. So God announced. You read God's opening words to the Israelites through Moses. After that, God invites them to become covenant partners. If you just listen to me is his invitation. Keep my covenant and you'll be my representatives. So then God tells Moses, all right, we're going to make this official. I'm going to come down on the mountain in storm and fire and cloud, and on the third day, you're going to hear the ram's horn. And now I'm into Exodus, verse 19, 12, and 13. And verse 13 introduces a really interesting detail where God says, on the third day, when the ram's horn is sounding, let the people come. And depending on what translation you read, you get a very different sense of what's happening. So the new Revised Standard Version says, let them come up onto the mountain, which is, I think, the most natural way of reading the Hebrew text there. But many of our other English translations say, let them come up to the mountain, not onto it, just to it. So John and I talked about this at length in the previous episode already, but maybe kind of tee us up. What do you see as the interpretive challenges in this story? Why these translation differences? And how have you sorted your way through this challenging story?",

    "text": "Yeah, well, it's challenging because the people say they don't want to go up the mountain. And so then God says, okay, you can't. And there seems to be a tension in Scripture about whether it was a good idea or a bad idea for them to not want to go up the mountain. I remember first reading these texts in Bible college and thinking, what a missed opportunity. They could have gone up the mountain, and they didn't. And now in Jesus, we can. And so let's lean into this. I think I've shifted on this. I think I have a different opinion now than I did when I first read it. And I'm basing this opinion on the work of Michael Kibbe, who is a professor of New Testament and academic dean at Great Northern University. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on this conundrum. He. He did his doctorate in New Testament. So he was looking at the way Hebrews 12 recapitulates or recaps this event. So tracing it from Exodus to Deuteronomy and then into Hebrews. And he says that this moment, verse 13, is a test. So you've done a test video. You've talked about how God sets up these tests. He believes that this is a test designed to demonstrate Israel's fear of God and that the proper response to an invitation to come up on the mountain where God is just to say, no, no, we can't approach a holy God. That that was the right response, and that this would then sort of galvanize their commitment to obey Moses as a mediator. So when they see that Moses can approach God and that they shouldn' shows both their fear of God and their trust in Moses as the mediator. And he traces that from Exodus into Deuteronomy and then on into Hebrews to kind of show exegetically how it works.",

And this is why reading the Bible in community is so important, because we can learn from each other. So let me say back to you what I'm hearing you say as you summarize Michael Kibbe. Because what God does say to Moses right before all of this is, listen, I'm going to come in a thick cloud. This is Exodus 19:9. So that the people can hear when I speak to you, and so they can trust in you permanently. So I'm guessing that's where Michael is really. He sees that as a preview that the goal of this is to set up Moses and the people's trust in Moses as a sole mediator. Is that right?",

He says Israel has not consistently demonstrated proper fear of God in the events leading up to Sinai. So he's not confident of their ability to respond appropriately to his presence. So the test here is to see whether they will respond appropriately. He says the human recipient's recognition of the divine presence and subsequent fear is a necessary precondition for moving forward in the story. So then he goes on, he surveys. There's seven different options for how to reconcile these. You know, how could God say this twice? Or is there a. Are we translating it wrong? Or, you know, what's going on? He talks about Sailhammer's approach to it, which I'm guessing you're familiar with, and shows why he doesn't think that works exegetically. But he concludes, the contradiction between saying, don't come up the mountain, come up the mountain, is intentional and therefore necessary for the flow of the narrative. And it plays a crucial role in the fulfillment of God's broader purposes at the mountain, which, as I already said, were to show fear of God and to establish that mediation is necessary. And so when Moses. When Moses intercedes for them, the narrative is showing that he's ready to move forward as the mediator God appointed him to be. And that's jumping ahead to chapter 32, when he intercedes for the people in chapter 32. That's the test of Moses. And God's presenting him with a test. Hey, should I destroy these people and start over with you? So they both get a test. Israel gets a test here at the foot of the mountain, and they say, no, we fear God. And then Moses gets a test in 32 with, hey, should I destroy these people and start over with you? And he says, no, I'm going to mediate. And so they both passed the test, and now we can go forward with the intended mediator.",

And that has to do with the narrative patterning of this story is massively patterned after Abraham's test on Mount Moriah and then Adam and Eve's test on the Eden Mount, when God showed up in the wind of the day. And there Adam and Eve hide themselves from God's presence. And that's viewed as a sad fear of the Lord, it was a fear that came too late. And whereas Abraham's decision to go up the mountain and even surrender the life of his seed, even though he knew that God said, the nations will be blessed through my seed. So how does that work?

Like, he reads the Abraham story in light of the Lament, Psalms and the Book of Job, where our questioning of God when he seems to be acting out of character, is held up as a positive thing that we should question God. And Abraham fails to do this. He just slavishly obeys in a case where there's a clear contradiction between promise and command. And so he. He shows exegetically like he does careful work through the Abraham story in Genesis 22 to show why this is the case. And I'm not going to be able to do it all off the top of my head, but his basic point is Abraham is treating God like a Canaanite deity that would require child sacrifice. He doesn't even question it. And what God wanted him to do was to intercede the way he interceded for Sodom and Gomorrah. When he intercedes for Sodom and Gomorrah, he gets down to, what if there's 10 righteous? But he doesn't go lower than that. And so Middleton thinks that here in Genesis 22, that God is asking Abraham to press in and find out that God would make a sacrifice just for one, keep negotiating down or keep pressing in to know God better. So, yes, Abraham shows faith, but his faith is misplaced. He shows that he actually doesn't know Yahweh as over and against other gods. So that throws a bit of a wrench in the parallel.",

And we have this image at the end of the video where there's this flaming door. You're like, I'm not going to walk through that flaming door. But then an arm comes out to lead you through it and you picture Moses going up the top of Sinai and it looks like he's going into his death. I mean, that's what Israel sees. But through the flaming door into the space where God and him can be together. And so it's this picture of can I trust God even though I have this sense of self Preservation, that's telling me not to. Or I'm second guessing God's wisdom based off of my own assessment of what I need. That's a cool thing to think about. It is the other way to think about this that you're suggesting is the opportunity that we have as God's human partners to engage with Him. And we see that with Abraham as he negotiates about Sodom and Gomorrah. We see it with Moses negotiating on behalf of Israel. And that's a cool thing to think about that we actually are invited to participate in actually. Yeah, actively negotiating with God. And those are kind of two completely different. They almost feel opposed to each other in some way. Like just trust God, even though it doesn't make sense. There's something beautiful there. I think there's something biblical there.

This is what you see say in Psalm 89, where the Psalmist is saying, look at all these great promises you made to David to have a king on the throne. And then halfway through the psalm, it's this, where are you? You don't seem to be upholding David as king the way you said you were going to. So there's a disjunction between what God says or what he promises and what we're observing in life.

So I actually think what resulted was even better than if they had gone up the mountain. God said, no, I'm going to come move down into your neighborhood. I'm coming down to where you are.

Excuse me, when later stories are patterned after earlier ones. So, for example, the establishment of the fire and the angels at the boundary of Eden, and you can't go back in, but the whole narrative is like, but I wish somebody could go back in. Like, we need somebody to go back in. And wouldn't that be great if it was to everybody? And so then you start having these narrative patterns of people, characters facing these life and death decisions, or life and death for the next generation, where they stand at that door, as it were, and whether or not they're going to trust and step towards what looks like death and then discover that it's actual real life. And that was the. What do you say? That's the force or the pressure that the Eden story was exerting on me all through Genesis, leading me up to be inclined to see that same dynamic here, namely that the ideal would be for all the people to be re. Entered back to Eden. But what happens is the people stay distant. And I do think there's something to the macro design, how the moment where the people say we don't want to go, or they say that they stand far away and push Moses up. And Moses says, this is a test. That's in chapter 20, verses 18 and following. That's at the literary center of all of 19 through 24. So there's something there that is really highlighting that moment that they want to be distant and Moses is the one who goes up. The pressure of the earliest patterns is what led me to see that as another concession, as it were. And so it's good that we have one, because if you have one, God can work with that one on behalf of all of the others. But it does point still to a lost ideal.",

I think it's the mercy of God, isn't it, that he drives Adam and Eve out of the garden because he doesn't want them to eat from the tree of life and live forever in that state, in that state of brokenness.

And I apply it to seeing Exodus as a creation story. And in so many ways, the book of Exodus is a creation story, the creation of the nation of Israel. And so I think that the tabernacle chapters echo the creation event because it's finally bringing them to the place where they can dwell in the presence of God. As Adam and Eve dwelt in God's presence in the garden, so so many things. God consecrates the seventh day of creation. He consecrates the tabernacle. There's cherubim, gard, the way to the tree of life. There's cherubim in the inner sanctuary of the tabernacle. There's a tree of life in the garden. There's a tree shaped candelabra in the sanctuary. There's gold and onyx in the Garden of Eden. There's golden onyx on, on the high priest garments. And in the tabernacle, you know, the other furniture has gold. The creation days go from evening to morning and evening and morning first day, and evening and morning the second day. And the lamps and the tabernacle are lit from evening to morning. So, so, so many echoes between the two. There's all these sevens in both stories, right? We have seven days of Genesis 1, but we have God issues the tabernacle instructions on Moses, seventh day on the mountain. So he waits six days and then he hears them on the seventh day. We hear that in chapter 24. The priest's ordination ceremony spans seven days. And then they're clothed with new garments, just like Adam and Eve are clothed in the garden. The ordination has seven days of atonement on the altar and the seven day ceremonies repeated for Aaron successors at the very end of the tabernacle instructions, the last thing we're told is that they should keep the Sabbath. So it's, the instructions are happening on the seventh day and we hear about the tabernacle and then we get Sabbath last. And it's the Sabbath instructions are the seventh of speeches. So we're on the seventh day and there's seven speeches about the tabernacle and the last one's about the Sabbath. I mean, it just seems like it's everywh story, like it's very Eden focused.",

Then the next narrative after the seven speeches conclude is the guy who's supposed to be wearing those clothes. The camera shifts down to Aaron, who is not only not being somebody who's ready for that kind of role, but he's making an image of a golden calf. And then you get the image, but Moses is the one up on the mountain and he's actually being the mediator. And he starts shining while he's up there mediating. And so you have this, you have this ideal priest, the guy who's supposed to fill the role, who's not fit for the job. And then you have his younger brother who actually seems to be doing the thing of what his Aaron should be doing on a good day.

And we see this again and again in the priestly ordination ceremony in Leviticus, Moses does all the things and Aaron is passive. Moses washes him, Moses dresses him, Moses does the sacrifices. Moses puts the stuff in Aaron's hands. So it really, we see Moses as a strong actor. He's the prophet, he's the one authorized to lead Aaron. Aaron is an interesting figure and I need to spend more time thinking about it, but he's a model for every Israelite, but he's almost like mute. Aaron doesn't say anything except the blessing, the priestly blessing that we see in numbers 6. He doesn't even dress himself. I have an article about Aaron's garments, his high priestly garments in which I talk about the clothes make the man. So Aaron actually has no special qualifications, you know, skill wise. He just, when he puts these clothes on and these things are done to him, he is able to perform his role. And I wonder if part of what we're seeing in the golden calf story is that God is going to take a very ordinary, flawed human being and that the ordination ceremony and the clothing is going to transform him so that he can be put in God's service the same way. The whole nation is flawed as a kingdom of priests and God takes them as they are and transforms them to be his representatives. Aaron's interesting because he's not autonomous. He has no authority outside his office. You know, in the Book of Numbers when there's that brush up between Aaron and Miriam and Moses. And they're complaining about Moses because, well, we're prophets too. Like, you know what's so fascinating about that is Miriam gets leprosy or lepra, however we translate that. And Aaron is powerless to do anything about it. And he has to come to Moses and say, will you pray for her? Because priests actually don't cure skin diseases. They just let you know if they are cured. And so Moses authority is so much greater. He's not just one of them with access to God.

It's a good thing that there is this mediator, but at the same time, the first character to ever fill the role. It's like the volume is turned up on his failure. And the same will happen with the only other main priest highlighted, which is Eli and his sons. And they're just as much of failures as Aaron.

They never become their own thing. They can't run the show. In fact, the very first story we have about priests after the priestly ordination in Leviticus 8 and 9 is the story of Nadab and Abihu. Like, first day after this thing is up and running, we hear about Nadab and by who, who bring unauthorized fire into the Tabernacle. They're innovating right away. They get too big for their britches. They're thinking, oh, I work here. Here's what I want to do. Here's what I feel like doing today. And it's very clear that, like, there is no tolerance for any kind of innovation. This is about strict adherence to protocol. So they don't. They don't have some kind of greater authority outside of the commands that God's given. And so it does turn our eyes to Moses as mediator.

And this is kind of going up and summarizing a theme from what we've been talking about. What is the significance of a story about the Sinai covenant, Israel and the law, that both the priest and the people fail in the very moment of its inception? And so thinking globally, because it's so. Especially depending on what Christian tradition you've been brought up in, you think, oh, the Old Testament that is teaching people about the law, and now that Jesus has come, it's about grace and so on. So I know that you don't buy into any of that, and I've learned a lot from you about how to correct those things. But it just seems so significant that in the story about the inception of the introduction of the law to Israel, its total failure from the start. What's the significance of that in the larger framework of the Hebrew Bible?",

    "text": "Yeah, good. I mean, I think anyone who's tried to do a Bible read through and they got to Exodus, the end of Exodus, and waited through five or six chapters of tabernacle instructions would be able to tell you it's kind of a letdown to, you know, you get some stories again in chapter 32 and 33, and then we're back into more tabernacle instructions. Like, we get all of the process of building the tabernacle takes as long to recount as the instructions. And it feels like, why Is this in here twice? But I think in the literary design of Exodus, it's super important that the instructions came before the golden calf and that the implementation of those instructions came after it. Because what it says to me is that Yahweh anticipated the need for forgiveness. He anticipated that these are sinful people, and they're going to need a way to reconcile, reconcile with me. And so before they even worshiped the golden calf, he was already designing a way to safely live in their neighborhood. And he was already putting into place what would need to happen so that they could be cleansed and the covenant would not be called off. This is one thing that persuades me with Mike Kibbe's thesis that, that when Moses is interceding in chapter 32, he's passing the test, that God was in fact giving him a test when he said, I will destroy you. That Moses passes the test by correctly discerning that he should mediate, not do away with these people. And so then when you have the building of the tabernacle, we get such detailed instructions, I think on purpose, to mirror the instructions that Moses was given to show, okay, we're actually following God's plan now, and this time it's going to work. So these two things are framing the golden calf, which is where we see a total apostasy. And I think maybe important to note that it's not like God just kind of snaps his fingers and says, oh, okay, I'm not going to punish you then for that terrible thing you did. Right. Like, there's this moment of violence where the Levites run around killing the people who were involved in this. This terrible orgy, worship, whatever they're doing. There's a sense in which those who have participated in apostasy have to experience the consequences, but the rest of the community now has a path for cleansing. Like, the. The residual effects of that sin are not going to hamper the covenant going forward because they have a tabernacle where those things can be dealt with, the sort of the sin of the community as a whole. So I think it illustrates both that God takes sin really seriously, but that he's very serious about forgiveness and about creating pathways for forgiveness for his people.",
