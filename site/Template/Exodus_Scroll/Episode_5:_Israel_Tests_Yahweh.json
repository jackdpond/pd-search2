    "text": "Yeah, I know. I've pondered that. I've pondered that for a long time. I mean, if you think about it, some of the plague, it's a reference back to the plagues on Egypt of which there were boils. I mean, what fits the category of what we would think of sickness from the 10 plagues would be like the boils and then the death of the firstborn, which was like a plague, a sickness, virus. We would say something of some kind. But what we're adding, we're adding to the vocabulary of life and death here. So we have desert versus garden, the words life or death. And here, sickness or healing. My hunch is there's something about the literary design of this section and that these words, sickness and healing actually match some other set of terms in the matching narrative. And I need to work on the section board to figure. Figure that out. But that's usually what happens, is biblical authors will introduce you very unique vocabulary, and you're like, what? What? And it's usually you need to wait to see the hyperlink somewhere later or earlier that you missed. That explains why that unique vocabulary is used. So here's what's going to happen right after this. There's going to be two more stories about a food crisis and a test, and they're all going to be much longer. So it's like you got the short, dense one first. It's like a riddle. And then you get the two longer, more clear ones second. And they all mutually match each other. And all three together are kind of like a little meditation. So the second narrative is long. We won't read the whole thing. But this is the famous manna. This is where the mana comes in. Yeah.",

    "text": "Hmm. I think we're foreshadowing a theme that will be explored in the prophets, especially Isaiah, that Israel was chosen to become the conduit of God's blessing to the nations. But the reason they were set apart, the nations, was always to rejoin them in the universal multi ethnic family of God so that the nations actually become in turn, a blessing back to Israel. And so all these images at the end of Isaiah about the nations coming back and helping rebuild and participate in the new Jerusalem, of bringing their gifts to the temple to make the city beautiful again. It's like once the blessing goes through Israel to the nations, then the nations become a blessing to God's covenant family. I think that's how it works. And this is like a little foreshadowing of that theme right here, before Mount Sinai even begins. These stories are so rich, man. All right, so that was the second part of this second movement in Exodus. And we're now going to come to the third part of the second movement, which is Israel arriving at Mount Sinai. And they're going to receive the laws of the covenant. And this will put a choice before Israel. This becomes their greatest test of trust. And that's what we're going to talk about next.",

I first heard about the Bible Project when I was in grade 10 in my youth group and my youth pastor showed me their first video. I use the Bible Project for my own spiritual growth and I like to share with my friends and new believers. My favorite thing about the Bible Project is that they provide free resources that explain the Bible in ways that are easy to understand but yet complex enough that you could learn about them in seminary. We believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus. We're a crowdfunded project by people like me. Find free videos, study notes, podcasts, classes, and much more@bibleproject.com.",
