So Jethro starts teaching his son in law instruction and wisdom. And he says, he teaches him how to organize a team and then delegate leadership to that team. And then he boldly says, you should listen to my voice. And by the way, through my voice, God is commanding you to do what I'm saying. You should build a team. And Moses listens to his father in law and things go well. And it's this precursor to the narrative we're about to step into here, which is both the wisdom of the nations and God's command end up pointing in the same direction.",

And then lo and behold, in the next story that we're going to look at, you know, now God appoints Moses as a mediator for the people to do exactly the thing that Jethro told him to do in the previous story. So I think there's something important going on here that the fear of the Lord and the wisdom of Jethro are one and the same, which is kind of cool. So we'll explore these things more. But the Jethro story is an important pivot in between the wilderness narratives and their arrival at Mount Sinai. So in Exodus chapter 19, we arrive at Mount Sinai. This is iconic stuff too. From the book of Exodus, there's probably two iconic moments that even somebody who doesn't know the Bible very well probably knows. These stories are somewhere in the first few books.",

    "text": "But what you're saying is the story feels kind of like a jumble to you. Yeah, yeah. You are not the first person to feel that this narrative block has actually a really unique design. But it has all the marks of, as. As we've been seeing, of meditation literature, which means it reads kind of funky when you just read it in a four word sequence. But when you reflect on its overall shape and its literary design, you see that it has a really remarkable mirror or symmetrical shape to it. And so what do you say? The sequence of the story as you read forward doesn't necessarily correspond to the actual Timing of the narrative. There's flash forwards and flashbacks here. And actually, I think the meaning of this story, which is called a test at the center of it, this is Israel's test at Mount Sinai. The meaning of it is actually bound up with seeing its literary design. At least that has been my experience trying to figure out the story. So let's do a quick overview of this block here. So this is Exodus 19: through 24. It begins with the words and in the third month after the sons of Israel left Egypt. So it's been three months in the third month. So they've been traveling through the wilderness since the night of Passover, which was the first month, the liberation from Egypt. And Passover marks a new year marked. Yeah, it's as if the calendar got restarted with Passover. It's a recreation. Even time gets recreated for Israel. So we're now three months in, and they arrive at the foot of a mountain, Mount Sinai, which is the very mountain Moses met God at, at the burning bush, you know, many years, many years ago. So that's how this section starts. And the exciting, jam packed action story that began, you know, with Exodus just grinds to a halt right here. We're going to stay parked at this mountain for the rest of Exodus, all of Leviticus and the first ten chapters of Numbers. And all of that material is going to transpire in what takes up one calendar year. So it's the center of the Torah that spans three books, three scrolls, and it is just dedicated to one year. So I think the book of Genesis kicks off in the first 11 chapters by sequencing forward like hundreds and thousands of years in 11 chapters. And now we're going to spend a lot of material on it.",

And he invites Israel to become his kingdom of priests. And the people say, yes, sign us up, we want to do it. God comes down in cloud and fire. That's chapter 19. God starts speaking and here the narrative stops and it's a long speech of God. And lo and behold, we have the ten Commandments. And these are the first, the ten words, the ten words that represent the first block of covenant. They're the terms of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. So they're not just random moral commands dropped out of the sky. They're covenant terms for the Israelites.",

And you get a flashback to the moment that God showed up at the cloud back in chapter 19. And there's a unique kind of form of Hebrew verbs that's used to set it aside as not progressing the narrative further, but actually giving you background information on the narrative that you read earlier. So this is like a flashback, and it flashes back to the moment that God showed up at the mountain in cloud and fire. And it tells you what the people said to Moses in that moment. And what they said to Moses in that moment is, whoa, this God's way too intense. We don't want to go near him. So Moses, you go, and we'll stand back. They stay far away. They don't want to come near. They want to go far. And there's that little story right there.

So again, just to kind of close this conversation about the overview of Exodus 19 to 24, what's cool about it is its design, in a way, to invite the reader to reread these chapters multiple times. The narrative is out of linear sequence in terms of time, but also is an alternating block of story with a block of laws, story with a block of laws, and then a concluding story. So it's just a really great example of meditation literature, which is part of this bigger paradigm. So we're trying to learn how to read these texts according to their design. And this is a really good example. All right, well, let's. Let's dive into the story. There's some really cool things going on in the story. And let's just start.

In the third month, after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day, they came to the wilderness of Sinai, and they set out from Rephidim and they came to the wilderness of Sinai, and they camped in the wilderness, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain. That probably sounds really redundant. It's really. Yeah, repetitious. It's a beautiful example of what in biblical studies that work on the literary design of biblical poetry, it's called a stair step design. So you begin from where Israel left. They went out of Egypt, and they came to the wilderness of Sinai. That's a first pass at the big picture. They left Egypt, they came to Sinai, and then the next set of lines comes in, and within that, from Egypt to Sinai fills in more detail by retelling it again, but with more detail. So now they set out not from Egypt, but from Rephidim. They came to the wilderness of Sinai. And then it zeroes in about once they came to the wilderness, they camped there in front of the mountain, in the wilderness. So it could have been written in a very straightforward, less complicated way, but poetically, it actually, it kind of takes you through the journey two times, filling in more detail on the second time. Anyway, that's kind of cool. Verse 3. And Moses ascended up to Elohim and Yahweh called to him from the mountain, saying, this is what you will say to the house of Jacob and tell to the sons of Israel. And these are well known lines. We've talked about them a lot over the years. You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt. And I bore you on the wings of eagles, and I brought you to myself.
